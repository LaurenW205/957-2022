LETTER OF PROMULGATION
1. The Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) Program is a
positive approach toward improving combat readiness and achieving a substantial reduction in the
aircraft mishap rate. Standardization, based on professional knowledge and experience, provides the
basis for development of an efficient and sound operational procedure. The standardization program
is not planned to stifle individual initiative, but rather to aid the Commanding Officer in increasing
the unit’s combat potential without reducing command prestige or responsibility.
2. This manual standardizes ground and flight procedures but does not include tactical doctrine.
Compliance with the stipulated manual requirements and procedures is mandatory except as
authorized herein. In order to remain effective, NATOPS must be dynamic and stimulate rather than
suppress individual thinking. Since aviation is a continuing, progressive profession, it is both
desirable and necessary that new ideas and new techniques be expeditiously evaluated and
incorporated if proven to be sound. To this end, Commanding Officers of aviation units are
authorized to modify procedures contained herein, in accordance with the waiver provisions
established by OPNAV Instruction 3710.7, for the purpose of assessing new ideas prior to initiating
recommendations for permanent changes. This manual is prepared and kept current by the users in
order to achieve maximum readiness and safety in the most efficient and economical manner. Should
conflict exist between the training and operating procedures found in this manual and those found
in other publications, this manual will govern.
3. Checklists and other pertinent extracts from this publication necessary to normal operations and
training should be made and carried for use in naval aircraft.

YOUR RESPONSIBILITY
NATOPS Flight Manuals are kept current through an active manual change program. Any
corrections, additions, or constructive suggestions for improvement of content of the manual should be
submitted by routine or urgent change recommendation, as appropriate, at once.
NATOPS FLIGHT MANUAL INTERIM CHANGES
Interim changes are changes or corrections to NATOPS manuals promulgated by CNO or
COMNAVAIRSYSCOM. Interim changes are issued either as printed pages, or as a Naval message.
The Interim Change Summary page is provided as a record of all interim changes. Upon receipt of a
change or revision, the custodian of the manual should check the updated Interim Change Summary
to ascertain that all outstanding interim changes have been either incorporated or canceled; those not
incorporated shall be recorded as outstanding in the section provided.
CHANGE SYMBOLS
Revised text is indicated by a black vertical line in either margin of the page, adjacent to the affected
text, like the one printed next to this paragraph. The change symbol identifies the addition of either
new information, a changed procedure, the correction of an error, or a rephrasing of the previous
material.
WARNING, CAUTIONS, AND NOTES
The following definitions apply to ‘‘WARNINGS’’, ‘‘CAUTIONS’’, and ‘‘NOTES’’ found throughout
the manual.
An operating procedure, practice, or condition, etc., which may result in
injury or death if not carefully observed or followed.
An operating procedure, practice, or condition, etc., which may result in
damage to equipment if not carefully observed or followed.
NOTE
An operating procedure, practice, or condition, etc., which is essential
to emphasize.
WORDING
The concept of word usage and intended meaning which has been adhered to in preparing this
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
54 ORIGINAL
manual is as follows:
″Land as soon as possible″ means to land at the first site which a safe landing can be made.
″Land as soon as practical″ means extended flight is not recommended. The landing site and
duration of flight is at the discretion of the pilot in command.
‘‘Shall’’ has been used only when application of a procedure is mandatory.
‘‘Should’’ has been used only when application of a procedure is recommended.
‘‘May’’ and ‘‘need not’’ have been used only when application of a procedure is optional.
‘‘Will’’ has been used only to indicate futurity, never to indicate any degree of requirement for
application of a procedure.
AIRSPEED
All airspeeds in this manual are in knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS) unless stated in other terms.
TERMINOLOGY
To standardize terminology throughout this publication, the following guidelines should be followed:
a. When specifying a switch, handle, or knob to be actuated in an emergency procedure, the name
of the switch, handle or knob should be written as it is labeled in the cockpit (i.e. LDG GEAR
handle).
b. When referencing a position of a switch, handle, or knob, the label as shown in the cockpit
should be used (i.e. ECS MODE switch − OFF/RAM).
c. LOT numbers should be used vice BUNO numbers when the entire LOT is affected. For
multiple LOTs use LOTs XX−XX or LOT XX and up as appropriate.
d. For MC OFP’s use terminology such as ″Prior to MC OFP 18E″ or ″MC OFP 18E and up″ to
avoid requiring a NATOPS change with each subsequent OFP release.
e. Procedures which are nested in other procedures such as the Emergency Oxygen Procedure
should contain only immediate action items.
f. When emergency procedures are referenced in the PCL, page numbers should be included to
facilitate quick location of the referenced procedure.
MANUAL DEVELOPMENT
This NATOPS Flight Manual was prepared using a concept that provides the aircrew with
information for operation of the aircraft, but detailed operation and interaction is not provided. This
concept was selected for a number of reasons: reader interest increases as the size of a technical
publication decreases, comprehension increases as the technical complexity decreases, and accidents
decrease as reader interest and comprehension increase. To implement this streamlined concept,
observance of the following rules was attempted:
a. Aircrew shall be considered to have above-average intelligence and normal (average) common
sense.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
55 ORIGINAL
b. No values (pressure, temperature, quantity, etc.) which cannot be read in the cockpit are
stated, except where such use provides the pilot with a value judgement. Only the information
required to fly the airplane is provided.
c. Notes, Cautions, and Warnings are held to an absolute minimum, since almost everything in
the manual could be considered a subject for a Note, Caution, or Warning.
d. No procedural data are contained in the Descriptive Section, and no abnormal procedures
(Hot Starts, etc.) are contained in the Normal Procedures Section.
e. Notes, Cautions and Warnings are not used to emphasize new data.
f. Multiple failures (emergencies) are not covered.
g. Simple words in preference to more complex or quasi-technical words are used and
unnecessary and/or confusing word modifiers are avoided.
A careful study of the NATOPS Flight Manual will probably disclose a violation of each rule stated.
In some cases this is the result of a conscious decision to make an exception to the rule. In many cases,
it only demonstrates the constant attention and skill level that must be maintained to prevent slipping
back into the old way of doing things.
In other words, the ‘‘Streamlined’’ look is not an accident, it takes constant attention for the
NATOPS Flight Manual to keep the lean and simple concept and to provide the aircrew with the
information required.

CHAPTER 1
The Aircraft
1.1 AIRCRAFT DESCRIPTION
1.1.1 Meet The Super Hornet. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is a carrier based strike fighter aircraft
built by McDonnell Douglas Corporation. The general arrangement, approximate dimensions, and
cockpit layout are shown in Figure 1-1, Figure 1-2, and the Cockpit Foldout section, respectively. The
multi-mission aircraft has an internal 20 mm gun and can carry AIM-7, AIM-9, and AIM-120 air-to-air
missiles; and numerous air-to-ground weapons. The aircraft fuel load may be increased with the
addition of up to five external fuel tanks. The aircraft can be configured as an airborne tanker by
carrying a centerline mounted air refueling store.
The aircraft is powered by two General Electric F414-GE-400 turbofan engines utilizing Full
Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). The aircraft features a variable camber mid-wing with
Figure 1-1. General Arrangement
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-1-1 ORIGINAL
leading edge extensions (LEX) mounted on each side of the fuselage. Twin vertical tails are angled
outboard 20 degrees from the vertical.
The aircraft is designed with relaxed static stability to increase maneuverability and to reduce
approach and landing speed. The aircraft is controlled by a digital fly-by-wire Flight Control System
through hydraulically actuated flight control surfaces: ailerons, twin rudders, leading edge flaps,
trailing edge flaps, LEX spoilers, and differential stabilators. The leading edge of the wing incorporates
a ‘‘snag,’’ which increases outboard wing area and increases roll authority in the approach and landing
configuration. A speed brake function is provided by differential deflection of the primary flight
control surfaces.
The pressurized cockpit is enclosed by an electrically operated clamshell canopy. An aircraft
mounted auxiliary power unit (APU) provides self-contained start capability for the engines.
1.1.2 Aircraft Gross Weight. Basic weight is approximately 31,500 pounds for the F/A-18E and
32,000 pounds for the F/A-18F. Refer to applicable DD 365-3 for accurate aircraft weight.
1.1.3 F/A-18F. The F/A-18F is the two seat model of the Super Hornet and is configured with
tandem cockpits. The rear cockpit can be configured with a stick, throttles, and rudder pedals (trainer
configuration); or with two hand controllers, a UFCD adapter, and foot-operated communication
switches (missionized configuration). The rear cockpit controls and displays operate independently of
those in the front cockpit.

1.1.4 Radar Cross Section (RCS) Reduction. RCS reduction is a significant feature of the F/A18E/F. While the maintenance community is tasked with maintaining the RCS features of the aircraft,
it is in the best interests of the aircrew community to take an active role to ensure the survivability
characteristics of the aircraft are retained.
RCS reduction is accomplished through numerous airframe design features. See figure 1-3. The
baseline feature is planform alignment of as many surface edges as feasible. The outer moldline of the
aircraft is treated to make it a smooth, conductive surface in order to reduce radar scattering.
Treatment entails metalizing the navigation lights, canopy, and windshield. Permanent joints and
gaps around infrequently opened panels are filled with a form-in-place (FIP) sealant, which is blended
flush and conductively painted. Gaps around frequently opened panels are filled with a conductive FIP
(CFIP) sealant, which allows for easier repair. Conductive tape is applied to a few gaps where there is
no substructure to support FIP material, such as along LEX edges. Conductive tape can also be used
to quickly repair damaged FIP joints.
Since CFIP in the gaps around frequently opened panels will experience the most wear and tear, a
corrosion-proof radar absorbing material (RAM) is applied in front of many of these gaps. RAM is also
applied (1) on the inlet lip and duct, (2) as diamond-shaped patches around drain holes, and (3) in
various locations that tend to highly scatter radar energy such as around pitot tubes, vertical tail
openings, vents and screens, flap hinges and fairings, and portions of the pylons and external tanks. A
multi-layer RAM is used in a few locations, such as around AOA probes and on the top, front surface
of the pylons.
Figure 1-3. Radar Cross Section (RCS) Reduction
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-1-3 ORIGINAL
Gaps around landing gear doors are treated in two ways. Nose landing gear doors use flexible
conductive blade seals on leading and trailing edges; main landing gear door edges are wrapped with
RAM. Scattering from trailing edges (i.e., trailing edge flaps and rudders) is controlled by a radar
absorbing boot which is bonded to the surface. Scattering from the back edge of the windshield is
controlled by a gray, laminated material called the aft arch termination strip.
The engine inlet ducts incorporate a device to minimize engine front face scattering. The edge of the
canopy incorporates a conductive bulb seal to block radar reflections from that joint. Conductive bulb
seals are also used where there is significant structural flexure, such as at the wing-to-LEX interface.
Eleven electro magnetic interference shields (EMIS) III radar shields are permanently installed on
the radar antenna hardware. To allow the aircraft to achieve its full RCS reduction potential, a
missionized kit consisting of twelve more EMIS III radar bulkhead shields, are installed for combat
missions only. Additionally, SUU-79 pylons can be fitted with a set of low observable (LO) hardware.

CHAPTER 2
Systems
2.1 POWER PLANT SYSTEMS
2.1.1 Engines. The aircraft is powered by two General Electric F414-GE-400 engines. The engines
are low bypass, axial-flow, twin-spool turbofans with afterburner. The three stage fan (low pressure
compressor) and the seven stage high pressure compressor are each driven by a single stage turbine.
The basic functions are supported by the engine driven accessory gearbox which drives the engine fuel
pump, variable exhaust nozzle (VEN/start) fuel pump, lubrication and oil scavenge pump, engine fuel
control, and alternator. Fuel flow from the VEN/start pump is used to drive the VEN actuator and to
provide initial fuel pressure for main engine start.
The uninstalled military thrust (MIL) of each F414-GE-400 engine is approximately 13,900 pounds
with maximum afterburner thrust (MAX) in the 20,700 pound class.
An inlet device is installed in each engine intake to reduce the aircraft radar signature and to
improve survivability.
2.1.1.1 FADEC - Full Authority Digital Engine Control. Engine operation is controlled by a full
authority digital engine control (FADEC), mounted on the engine casing. Each FADEC computer has
two central processor units, channel A (CH A) and channel B (CH B), and is integrated with the
Mission Computers (MCs), flight control computers (FCCs), and throttles. Normally, both FADEC
channels monitor engine and control system operation with one channel in control and the other in
standby. The channel currently in control is boxed on the SUPT MENU/ENG display.
In the event of a control system failure, the FADEC automatically selects the channel with better
capability. Manual FADEC channel transfer can be commanded by selecting the CH A or CH B
pushbutton on the ENG display. When the throttle is at or above IDLE, the FADEC transfers control
to the other channel only if the requested channel’s health is no worse than the channel in control.
FADEC software implements the engine control schedules by modulating fuel flow and engine
geometry for the current flight conditions and the ″requested″ throttle setting. With the throttles
matched, engine parameters may vary significantly between the engines as control schedules are
adjusted for optimum performance. Therefore, a mismatch between engine parameters is not a sign of
degraded performance as long as ENG STATUS is NORM. FADEC cooling is provided by the fuel
system.
2.1.1.1.1 FADEC Power Sources. Prior to first engine start, the battery is used to power CH A of
both FADECs. When N2 reaches 10% rpm during start, the engine driven alternator comes online and
powers both channels of its corresponding FADEC. When an aircraft generator comes online (N2
greater than 60%), the aircraft’s electrical system provides power to both channels of the other FADEC
as well. With both engines operating, each engine driven alternator is the primary source of FADEC
power with the aircraft’s 28 vdc essential bus as backup. When both channels of a FADEC are powered
after initial start, the FADEC automatically switches operation to the channel which was not in control
during the last flight/engine run.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-1 ORIGINAL
Ten seconds after reaching idle power, the FADEC attempts to switch to the 28 vdc essential bus to
verify that backup power is available. If backup power is inadequate/inoperative, the FADEC declares
a channel degrade (dual channel lineout) and sets a 6A8 or 6C8 MSP code (L or R FADEC/aircraft 28V
fail). These degrade indications appear if the first engine is started with the corresponding GEN switch
OFF, and requires a FADEC reset to restore normal engine indications.
2.1.1.1.2 Engine Status. Engine status is reported by the FADEC and appears on the ENG
STATUS line of the ENG display. The levels of engine performance capability, listed in descending
order, are:
NORM Engine performance is normal
PERF90 10% or less thrust loss and/or slower engine transients. Afterburner is not
inhibited
AB FAIL No afterburner capability
THRUST Engine thrust is limited to between 40% and 90% and significantly slower
transients
IDLE Engine is limited to idle power only
SHUTDOWN Engine automatically shut down
2.1.1.1.3 FADEC/Engine Degrades. FADEC/engine degrades fall into two categories: minor failures
which do not affect engine operability and significant failures that do affect engine operability.
Due to a high level of FADEC redundancy, most minor control system failures do not cause any
degradation in engine performance (ENG STATUS remains NORM). Cockpit indications for these
types of failures are slightly different depending on whether the aircraft is inflight or on the ground.
Inflight -
a. FADEC and BIT advisories.
b. ENG STATUS - NORM.
c. OP GO indication for the affected engine channel on the BIT/HYDRO MECH display.
On the ground or below 80 KCAS after landing -
a. FADEC and BIT advisories.
b. ENG STATUS - NORM.
c. DEGD replaces OP GO for the affected engine channel on the BIT/HYDRO MECH display.
d. Both CH A and CH B lined out on the ENG display.
A FADEC OP GO or DEGD with an ENG STATUS of NORM is an indication of a loss of control
system redundancy and not of a loss of engine operability. Therefore, a FADEC OP GO inflight should
be considered informative and should not mandate a mission abort. However, on the ground, the
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-2 ORIGINAL
FADEC DEGD and dual channel lineout indications are intended to prevent takeoff with a known loss
of redundancy and maintenance action is required. Therefore, takeoff with a FADEC DEGD indication
(dual channel line out) is prohibited.
Significant failures which do cause degradation in engine performance have the following indications
both inflight and on the ground:
a. L or R ENG caution and voice alert.
b. FADEC and BIT advisories.
c. ENG STATUS change on the ENG display.
d. DEGD indication for the affected engine channel on the BIT/HYDRO MECH display.
e. Both CH A and CH B lined out on the ENG display.
2.1.1.1.4 FADEC Reset. When a throttle is OFF, the corresponding FADEC uses a channel change
request as a FADEC software reset. FADEC reset capability is provided to clear a DEGD indication
which was caused by a momentary FADEC fault (e.g., startup power transient). A FADEC reset should
only be performed for DEGD indications which occur on the ground and which do not result in a
change of ENG STATUS. For a FADEC OP GO inflight, engine shutdown and FADEC reset is not
recommended as the engine is functioning normally. In all other circumstances, a FADEC reset should
not be attempted, particularly airborne, as any degrade in ENG STATUS is most likely indicative of
the failure of a mechanical component. Under these conditions, the engine may fail to restart following
a shutdown and FADEC reset attempt.
2.1.1.1.5 Ignition System. The FADEC provides simultaneous control of the main and afterburner
igniters via the engine driven alternator and ignition exciter. Ignition (both main engine and
afterburner) is commanded whenever:
a. N2 rpm is between 10% and 45% during engine start.
b. Flameout occurs.
c. Throttle is advanced into afterburner, remaining on until afterburner light off is sensed.
d. The gun is fired, or any wing pylon mounted A/A or forward firing A/G weapon is launched.
Ignition remains on for 5 seconds.
2.1.1.1.6 Oil Pressure Sensing System. The oil pressure sensing system utilizes an oil pressure
transducer and a separate oil pressure switch. The transducer provides an oil pressure value for display
in the cockpit. The oil pressure switch provides an additional source to confirm the presence of oil
pressure if the oil pressure transducer fails.
If a L or R OIL PR caution is set with a valid cockpit readout, actual engine oil pressure is below
scheduled limits. If the cockpit readout is zero with no caution set, the oil pressure transducer has
failed and the pressure switch is inhibiting the caution.
2.1.1.1.7 Engine Idle Schedules. Each FADEC modifies engine idle schedules based on weight on
wheels (WonW) status, aircraft flight condition, engine bleed demand, and environmental control
system (ECS) mode of operation. The purpose of idle scheduling is to ensure that engine bleed output
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-3 ORIGINAL
is always sufficient to run the ECS, particularly the aircrew onboard oxygen generating system
(OBOGS).
Baseline idle schedules are used during normal engine operation and moderate environmental
conditions, and are set as a function of pressure altitude and WonW status. With WonW and airspeed
below 80 knots, the FADEC commands ground idle by reducing the engine compressor discharge
pressure (CDP) (typically a slight decrease in N2 rpm) from the inflight idle setting. The throttle
handle angle (THA) for ground and inflight idle are identical.
In LOT 26 and up, with WoffW, spin recovery mode not engaged, and inflight refueling probe and
landing gear (and hook in LOT 24 and below) retracted, baseline flight idle thrust LOT 26 and up is
higher than in LOT 25 and below. Ground idle thrust is not affected.
Alternate idle schedules are used when engine bleed demands are high (e.g., hot ambient
temperatures, high ECS output, RECCE configuration, engine or windshield anti-ice operation, or
ECS OFF/RAM mode). When an alternate idle schedule is requested, the FADEC increases the
minimum CDP that is commanded at idle power (typically a slight increase in N2 rpm), which may also
result in a noticeable decrease in throttle response at the lower end of the throttle range. With the
throttles near flight idle, a small engine transient may be noticed when an alternate idle schedule is
activated or when a transition between alternate idle schedules occurs.
In LOT 26 and up, when an alternate idle schedule is activated flight idle thrust can be double that
for LOT 25 and below aircraft.
Alternate idle schedules are deactivated with WonW, when spin recovery mode is engaged, or when
the inflight refueling probe or landing gear (or hook in LOT 24 and below) are extended. When
alternate idle schedules are deactivated in LOT 26 and up, a small noticeable engine transient may
occur with the throttle near flight idle, and the resulting flight idle thrust is identical to LOT 25 and
below baseline flight idle thrust.
2.1.1.1.8 Fan Speed Lockup. The fan speed lockup system prevents inlet instability (buzz) at high
Mach by holding engine speed and airflow at military power levels when the throttle(s) are retarded
below MIL. Speed lockup is activated when the aircraft accelerates above Mach 1.23 and deactivated
when the aircraft decelerates below Mach 1.18.
2.1.1.1.9 SETLIM - Supersonic Engine Thrust Limiting. SETLIM minimizes the potential for an
aircraft departure due to asymmetric thrust following an engine stall or flameout at certain supersonic
(Mach greater than 1.8) or high-q conditions equivalent to approximately 700 KCAS at sea level or 750
KCAS at 25,000 feet. If the FADEC detects a stall or flameout condition, this function terminates
afterburner operation in both engines. Normal afterburner operation is restored 12 seconds after
engine recovery or immediately when airspeed drops below Mach 1.7 and q-conditions are equivalent
to approximately 650 KCAS at sea level or 710 KCAS at 25,000 feet.
2.1.1.1.10 RATS - Reduced Authority Thrust System. The reduced authority thrust system (RATS)
reduces the wind-over-deck required for carrier landings by rapidly reducing thrust at the beginning
of a successful arrestment, reducing the energy absorbed by the arresting gear. RATS logic, only
resident in MC1, declares a successful arrestment if the landing gear and arresting hook are down and
longitudinal deceleration is more than 1.0g (a typical arrestment is approximately 3g). MC1 sends a
″set RATS on″ signal to the FADECs, which reduce thrust to approximately 70% of MIL power. RATS
logic also senses WonW, wheel speed (less than 20 knots), and THA to prevent the engines from
spooling back to MIL power at the end of cable pullout. RATS operation is canceled when the throttles
are reduced to IDLE (THA less than 10°). RATS operation is inhibited during single engine operation.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-4 ORIGINAL
RATS operation can be overridden by advancing the throttles to full afterburner (THA within 2° of
the MAX stop). With RATS enabled, afterburner operation is inhibited if the throttles are
subsequently advanced to afterburner (below the MAX stop). If the throttles are in afterburner (below
the MAX stop) during an arrested landing, RATS functions normally, rolling back both the main
engine and the afterburner.
2.1.1.1.11 AGI (Armament Gas Ingestion) Protection. AGI protection provides preemptive engine
ignition in case armament gas ingestion causes an engine flameout. As mechanized, AGI protection is
a backup to the FADEC’s inherent flameout detection and relight logic. While flight test data indicates
that the system may not be needed, AGI protection remains functional.
The AGI signal is sent by the Stores Management Set (SMS) to the FADECs and is used to initiate
engine ignition (both engines) for 5 seconds. The signal is sent when the gun is fired, or or any wing
pylon mounted A/A or forward firing A/G weapon is launched. AGI is functional in the SIM mode as
well as the tactical mode.
2.1.1.1.12 IBU (Increased Bleed Usage) Signal In LOT 26 and up, during high bleed flow rates, the
mission computers may send the FADECs an IBU signal to prevent engine turbine overheating. When
IBU scheduling is active, hot day MIL and MAX thrust may be reduced by up to 1.5% compared to
LOT 25 and below aircraft.
2.1.1.1.13 ABLIM - Afterburner Limiting Function. The ABLIM function limits engine power to
half afterburner with the throttles at MAX to prevent engine stalls due to exhaust gas ingestion. The
system is only to be used during carrier-based operations. The function is pilot selectable with WonW.
The system defaults to disabled (unboxed) after engine start. The ABLIM function is activated by
selecting (boxing) the ABLIM option on the CHKLIST format with the FLAP switch in HALF or
FULL. The ABLIM advisory is set to confirm that the function has been activated on both engines.
With the function activated, only half afterburner power is available with the throttles at MAX.
Indicated fuel flows are reduced from 35,000 to 45,000 pph to about 25,000 pph. The function is
automatically deactivated with acceleration due to a catapult launch, at 80 KCAS, or with WoffW. The
ABLIM function is disabled with a FCC CH 1, FCC CH 2, FCC CH 4, MC1, or FADEC failure.

2.1.1.3 Engine Anti Ice. Each engine supplies its own bleed air for engine and inlet device anti-ice.
The engine anti-ice system is normally controlled by the ENG ANTI ICE switch. However, after engine
start (initial FADEC power-up or following a FADEC reset), the engine anti-ice system automatically
turns on 45 seconds after the engine reaches idle power and remains on for 30 seconds, provided the
throttle remains at IDLE. The appropriate LHEAT or RHEAT advisory is displayed during this
anti-ice functional test.
With the ENG ANTI ICE switch ON, anti-ice air flows as long as INLET TEMP is between -40
and +15°C. Outside of these limits, anti-ice airflow is terminated immediately if airborne, or after 60
seconds with WonW. When anti-ice air is flowing, N2 rpm increases approximately 2%, and EGT
increases approximately 5°C.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-5 ORIGINAL
The inlet device has an anti-ice leak detection system. The system detects hot air leaks from the
device air manifold or in the cavity between the device and the airframe and sets the L or R DEVC
BLD caution. A hot air leak into the cavity reduces device anti-ice capability and may structurally
damage the device and surrounding structure.
2.1.1.3.1 ENG ANTI ICE Switch. The ENG ANTI ICE switch is located on the ECS panel on the right
console.
ON Activates the engine anti-ice system
OFF Deactivates the engine anti-ice system
TEST Checks ice detector operation and displays the INLET ICE caution (indicating proper
operation).
2.1.1.3.2 Engine Anti-Ice Advisories. The L HEAT and R HEAT advisories are displayed when the
engine anti-ice system is activated (ENG ANTI ICE switch ON or anti-ice functional test) and no
system failures are detected. If an engine anti-ice failure occurs with the system turned on, the HEAT
FAIL caution is displayed and the corresponding L HEAT or R HEAT advisory is removed.
If an engine anti-ice failure occurs with the ENG ANTI ICE switch OFF, the HEAT advisory is
displayed. This advisory indicates that anti-ice operation is degraded or not available if selected.
2.1.1.3.3 Engine Anti-Ice Related Cautions and Advisories. The following engine anti-ice related
cautions and advisories are described in the Warning/Caution/Advisory Displays in Part V:

D HEAT FAIL caution
D INLET ICE caution
D L HEAT or R HEAT advisory
D HEAT advisory
2.1.1.4 Engine Controls and Displays.
2.1.1.4.1 ENG CRANK Switch. The ENG CRANK switch is described in the Secondary Power
System section.
2.1.1.4.2 Throttles. Two throttles, one for each engine, are located on the left console. Throttle
movement is transmitted electrically to the corresponding FADEC for thrust modulation and to the
FCCs for autothrottle operation. There is no mechanical linkage between the throttles and the engines.
During engine start, advancing the throttles from OFF to IDLE opens the engine fuel control shutoff
valves and, when commanded by the FADEC, provides fuel flow to the engines.
Afterburner operation is initiated by advancing the throttles through the MIL detent into the
afterburner range. During catapult launch or carrier touchdown (WonW and launch bar or arresting
hook extended), an afterburner lockout mechanism extends to preclude inadvertent afterburner
selection. In such cases, the throttles can be moved to the afterburner range by raising the finger lifts
on the front of each throttle or by applying a force of approximately 30 pounds.
During engine shutdown, the finger lifts must be raised to move the throttles to OFF, closing the
engine fuel control shutoff valves. The throttle grips (figure 2-1) contain switches that allow control of
various systems without moving the hand from the throttles.
2.1.1.4.3 Throttles (Trainer Configured F/A-18F). The rear cockpit of the trainer configured
F/A-18F contains an additional set of flight controls: control stick, throttles, and rudder pedals. The
rear cockpit throttles, located on the left console, are mechanically connected to those in the front
cockpit and provide thrust modulation from IDLE to MAX. The rear throttles do not contain finger
lifts, so the engines cannot be secured from the rear cockpit. The rear throttle grips are slightly
different than those in the front cockpit. The ATC engage/disengage switch is not functional; the
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-6 ORIGINAL
chaff/flare/ALE-50 switch is not installed; and the speed brake switch is momentary action only. In
general, systems controlled by throttle switches respond to the last crewmember action taken from
either cockpit.
2.1.1.4.4 EFD - Engine Fuel Display, Engine Parameters. The EFD, located on the main instrument
panel below the left digital display indicator (LDDI), is a night vision imaging system (NVIS)
compatible, monochromatic, liquid-crystal, grey/black display powered by the Signal Data Computer
(SDC).
The EFD normally displays critical engine parameters in the bottom half of the display and fuel
quantities in the top half. The fuel portion of the EFD is described in the Fuel System section. Invalid
parameters are usually displayed as 999 or 9999 in inverse video; out of limit parameters are always
highlighted by inverse video. Nozzle position is displayed both graphically and digitally in percent
open.
On battery power prior to APU start, the EFD either displays only RPM and TEMP or the entire
top level format (figure 2-2). If the entire top level format is not displayed on battery power, it will be
displayed when the APU switch is selected ON. When the APU switch is selected ON, only RPM,
TEMP, and OIL pressure are valid. When the first engine alternator comes online at 10% N2 rpm, the
FF parameter also becomes valid. When the first generator comes online at 60% N2 rpm, all
parameters for both engines become valid. If the EFD locks up or blanks completely during engine
start power transients, the display can be reset by selecting the SDC RESET option from the SUPT
MENU/FUEL display.
The EFD displays the following engine parameters within the listed display tolerances:
RPM Compressor rpm (N2 ) (0 to 127%) - Displays RPM in inverse video format above
102%
Figure 2-1. Throttle Grips (Front Cockpit)
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-7 ORIGINAL
TEMP Compensated turbine exhaust gas temperature (EGT) (186 to 1,088°C) - Displays 9999
in inverse video above 1,100°C
FF Total commanded fuel flow including afterburner (0 or 400 to 65,000 pph in 100 pph
increments).
NOTE
Engine fuel flow is calculated from commanded engine fuel metering
valve position. In failure modes, fuel flow can be indicated on the EFD
even though no actual fuel is flowing.
OIL Oil pressure (0 to 200 psi)
NOZ VEN position (0 to 101% open)
During first engine battery start, the EFD RPM indication typically jumps from 0 to either 5% or
10%, and lightoff is indicated by TEMP rising from a minimum reported value of approximately
190°C. Each engine has three sources of N2 rpm: two engine alternator sensors and one accessory
gearbox sensor. The accessory gearbox sensor can provide rpm readings down to only 5% and is the
initial source of engine RPM. Readings from the alternator sensors are not available until the
alternator comes online above 10% N2 rpm. Input for the TEMP parameter is provided by a
compensated EGT algorithm in the FADEC. When actual EGT is below accuracy tolerances (e.g.,
engine shutdown), the FADEC limits the minimum reported TEMP (approximately 190°C). The FF
parameter is a calculated number based on metering valve position, not an actual measurement of fuel
flow. Consequently, an indication of fuel flow may be present when there is no flow, such as when the
throttle is above IDLE with the engine off.

2.1.1.4.5 ENG Display. The ENG display (figure 2-3) is selected by pushing the ENG option from the

When an engine or thermal management system related caution appears, the MENU option at the
bottom of each DDI is replaced with the ENG option, providing one pushbutton access to the ENG
display. The value of the out of limit parameter which triggered the caution is displayed in red and
highlighted by carets on either side. The CH A and CH B options at the top of the display are used to
command a manual FADEC channel transfer, and the active FADEC channel for each engine is boxed.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-9 ORIGINAL
The selected fuel grade is displayed top center and also on the takeoff side of the CHKLIST display.
The FUEL option enables the JP-5, 8, and JP-4 options, each of which must be selected twice to change
the fuel grade. The fuel grade selected should reflect the majority of fuel in the aircraft. JP-5, -8 should
be selected when using JET-A, A+, or A1. The engines can be started and operated at ground idle with
either fuel grade selected; however, for operations above IDLE, the correct fuel grade must be selected
to ensure proper engine operation and to avoid engine combustor rumble. The fuel grade selected is
also used by the FADEC to control the thermal control valve (TCV) setting and determines the
maximum fuel temperature to be sent to the engines. Incorrect fuel grade selection can adversely
impact the fuel thermal management system and result in a premature FUEL HOT caution. The
RECORD option, boxed when selected, saves a 30 second record of display and engine data (15 seconds
pre- and 15 seconds post-event) to the memory unit (MU). The DFIRS DWNLD option downloads
DFIRS data to the MU.
2.1.2 ATC - Automatic Throttle Control. The ATC system has two operating modes: approach and
cruise. The system automatically modulates engine thrust between flight IDLE and MIL power in
order to maintain on-speed angle of attack (AOA) in the approach mode or calibrated airspeed
(existing at the time of engagement) in the cruise mode.
During ATC operation, engine commands are sent to the FADEC directly from the FCCs instead of
the throttles. FCC generated engine commands are limited to a range slightly above idle to slightly
below MIL. The throttles are continuously positioned by an FCC commanded backdrive unit to match
the throttles with the current engine command and to provide feedback to the pilot.
2.1.2.1 ATC Engagement. Pressing and releasing the ATC button on the left throttle engages the
approach mode with the FLAP switch in HALF or FULL and the cruise mode with the FLAP switch
in AUTO. When either mode is engaged, an ATC advisory is displayed on the HUD. Because ATC
mode engagement and ATC HUD advisories are not commanded until release of the ATC button, the
pilot may need to deliberately pause after press and release to avoid inadvertant ATC disengagement/
re-engagement. Automatic transition between the two modes or engagement during single engine
operation is not possible. Engaging ATC with the friction lever in the full aft position and with the
Figure 2-3. Engine Display
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-10 ORIGINAL
throttles at mid-range power provides optimum pilot feedback with the smallest engagement power
transients.
2.1.2.2 ATC Disengagement. If either mode does not engage when selected, or automatically
disengages after engagement, the ATC advisory flashes for 10 seconds and is removed from the HUD.
Disengagement for any reason requires reengagement to restore ATC operation. Normal disengagement is accomplished by re-actuation of the ATC button or by applying a force of approximately 12
pounds (friction off) to either throttle for greater than 0.20 seconds. This force is sufficient to permit
the pilot’s hand to follow throttle movement without causing disengagement. Holding the throttles
against the MIL or IDLE stop during ATC disengagement commands a rapid acceleration or
deceleration to the commanded power setting instead of a smooth transition.
2.1.2.3 ATC Automatic Disengagement. The ATC system automatically disengages for the following
reasons:
Either mode -
• Any ATC system internal failure
• ATC button failure
• FADEC failure
• FCC CH 2 or CH 4 failure
• Backdrive failure
• THA split greater than 3° for more than 1 second
• FLAP switch position change between AUTO and HALF or FULL
Approach mode only -
• AOA, pitch rate, or Nz sensor failure
• Bank angle in excess of 70°
• Flap blowup at 250 KCAS
• Gain ORIDE selection
• Weight on wheels
Cruise mode only -
• FCC calibrated airspeed failure
2.1.2.4 ATC Related Cautions. The ATC FAIL caution is described in the Warning/Caution/
Advisory Displays in Part V.
2.2 FUEL SYSTEM
The aircraft is fitted with four internal fuselage tanks (Tanks 1 through 4), two internal wing tanks
(left and right), two fuselage vent tanks, and two vertical vent tanks. Tanks 2 and 3 are engine feed
tanks while Tanks 1, 4, and the wing tanks are transfer tanks. Total fuel can be increased by the
carriage of up to four 480 gallon external fuel tanks on the centerline, inboard, and midboard pylons.
The aircraft can also be configured as an airborne tanker with the carriage of a centerline mounted air
refueling store (ARS). All tanks, internal and external, may be refueled on the ground through a
single-point refueling receptacle or inflight through the inflight refueling probe.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-11 ORIGINAL
The aircraft’s fuel system is composed of the following subsystems: engine feed, motive flow, fuel
transfer, tank pressurization and vent, thermal management, refueling, fuel dump, fuel quantity
indicating, and fuel low level indicating. Refer to Fuel System, Foldout Section, for simplified
schematics.
2.2.1 Engine Feed System. Each engine feed system contains an airframe mounted accessory drive
(AMAD) driven motive flow/boost pump, a feed tank with an internal motive flow powered turbo
pump, and an engine feed shutoff valve. For survivability, the left and right feed systems are normally
separated but can be interconnected by a normally closed crossfeed valve and a normally closed feed
tank interconnect valve.
2.2.1.1 Motive Flow/Boost Pumps. Each AMAD drives a two-stage motive flow/boost pump. The
first stage supplies low pressure fuel to its respective engine mounted fuel pump, while the second stage
supplies high pressure fuel to the motive flow system. Fuel from the motive flow system is used to cool
accessories, power the feed tank turbo pumps and certain transfer/scavenge pumps, and control certain
transfer valves.
2.2.1.2 Feed Tanks. During normal operation, each engine receives fuel from separate fuel feed lines.
Tank 2 supplies fuel to the left engine; Tank 3 to the right. A motive flow powered turbo pump in each
feed tank supplies fuel to its respective motive flow/boost pump.
Each feed tank has a horizontal baffle which traps fuel, providing a minimum of 10 seconds of
negative g flight at MAX power. No sustained zero g capability is provided, and prolonged transitions
through zero g (greater than 2 seconds) may produce a L and/or R BOOST LO caution.
If a feed tank turbo pump fails, fuel is suction fed to the motive flow/boost pump. In this case, flight
at high altitude with high feed tank fuel temperatures may not supply enough fuel for high power
settings.
2.2.1.3 Feed Shutoff Valves. In the event of a fire or fuselage fuel leak, engine feed shutoff valves
provide the capability to isolate a fuel feed system immediately downstream of the feed tank. Pressing
the L or R FIRE warning light electrically closes the corresponding engine feed shutoff valve, isolating
that fuel feed system.
2.2.1.4 Crossfeed Valve. The crossfeed valve, normally closed, allows a single motive flow/boost
pump to feed both engines when boost pressure is lost on one side (e.g., single engine shutdown, a leak,
motive flow/boost pump failure, or feed tank depletion). A loss of boost pressure downstream of the
motive flow/boost pump sets the L or R BOOST LO caution and opens the crossfeed valve. An open
crossfeed valve allows the output from the good motive flow/boost pump to supply fuel to the opposite
engine at rates sufficient for at least MIL power.
Pressing the L or R FIRE warning light electrically closes (inhibits opening) the crossfeed valve,
isolating the two fuel feed systems.
2.2.1.5 Interconnect Valve. A feed tank interconnect valve, installed between Tanks 2 and 3, is used
to control gravity transfer/balancing between the two feed tanks. During normal operation, the dual
flapper-type valve is held closed by motive flow pressure on either side (left motive flow on the Tank
2 side and right motive flow on the Tank 3 side), and no fuel gravity transfers.
If motive flow is lost on one side (e.g., single engine shutdown), the valve opens to make sure that
feed tank fuel is available to the opposite engine. For instance, if motive flow is lost on the right side,
the Tank 3 side of the valve opens, allowing fuel to gravity transfer to Tank 2 anytime the Tank 3 fuel
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-12 ORIGINAL
level is higher. If Tank 3 has a fuel leak (e.g., battle damage), motive flow pressure on the Tank 2 side
of the valve prevents Tank 2 fuel from gravity transferring into the leak.
2.2.1.6 Feed Tank Balancing. The SDC incorporates feed tank balancing logic, designed to keep
Tanks 2 and 3 within 100 lb of each other. With a normally operating fuel system, balancing begins
after Tank 4 is effectively empty (less than about 300 lb) and the feed tanks begin to deplete below full.
If a feed tank imbalance reaches 100 lb, the SDC shuts off the corresponding Tank 4 scavenge pump
until the imbalance is 50 lb in the opposite direction. With WoffW, feed tank balancing continues until
either feed tank reaches FUEL LO level (approximately 1,125 lb). Feed tank balancing stops at FUEL
LO to make sure tank 4 fuel is transferred to both feed tanks in case one feed tank is damaged and is
leaking. After transitioning to WonW, balancing is reinitiated and continues until either feed tank is
below 300 lb.
In the event of a fuel transfer failure (e.g., a feed tank begins to deplete with fuel in Tank 4), feed
tank balancing begins when either feed tank drops below approximately 2,100 lb for 1 minute. This
mechanization attempts to minimize the effect of the fuel transfer failure by reducing the resulting
feed tank split.
2.2.1.7 Feed Tank Imbalance with One Engine at Idle. If one engine is intentionally reduced to
idle/low power or is commanded to IDLE by the FADEC, a higher rate of fuel depletion can be
expected from the ″good″ engine’s feed tank. At internal fuel weights below approximately 4,900 lb
(transfer fuel depleted), a fuel split can be expected to develop between the feed tanks (interconnect
valve is closed). If fuel burn continues to approximately 2,450 lb, the good engine feed tank depletes
and runs dry. The motive flow/boost pump output pressure on the good side drops, sets the L or R
BOOST LO caution, and opens the crossfeed valve. The good engine feeds from the opposite feed tank
through the crossfeed valve.
When driven by an idling engine, a motive flow/boost pump can support fuel flow up to 28,000 pph
through the crossfeed valve (MIL power fuel flow is approximately 12,000 pph at sea level, standard
day). If the fuel flow demand on the usable engine exceeds 28,000 pph (midrange afterburner), motive
flow/boost pump output pressure drops, setting the other BOOST LO caution, closing the crossfeed
valve, and starving the good engine. MAX power, single engine fuel flow is approximately 38,500 pph
at sea level, 0.2M, standard day (approach conditions).
Selecting afterburner on the good engine with its feed tank reading empty
results in engine flameout if fuel flow exceeds 28,000 pph.
The only way to balance a growing feed tank split is to shutdown the idling engine. This opens both
the interconnect and crossfeed valves. The risk of balancing is a loss of hydraulic and electrical
redundancy provided from the engine if left at idle.
2.2.2 Fuel Transfer System. The fuel transfer system, controlled by the SDC, is designed to keep the
feed tanks full or near full during normal engine operation. Fuel is routed from Tanks 1 and 4, the
internal wing tanks, and external fuel tanks, if installed, through three independent sets of transfer
lines. Additionally, the SDC schedules Tank 1 and 4 transfer to control fuel center of gravity (CG).
2.2.2.1 Fuel Transfer - Tanks 1 and 4. Fuel is transferred from Tanks 1 and 4 to the feed tanks by
two dual-speed electric transfer pumps, one in each tank. The low speed setting is used for normal
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-13 ORIGINAL
transfer. The high speed setting is used during high fuel flow conditions such as afterburner operation,
ARS replenishment, or fuel dump. The one exception to this is that the Tank 1 transfer pump remains
in low speed setting during afterburner operation. During normal operation, each pump pressurizes the
Tank 1 and 4 transfer line as long as its tank has transfer fuel available. The SDC shuts down the
electric transfer pumps when the respective tanks are dry (Tank 1 empty, Tank 4 approximately 300
lb).
Jet level sensors (JLS) in the feed tanks control the flow of transfer fuel from the Tank 1 and 4
transfer line. For instance, Tank 2 does not accept fuel until its fuel quantity drops to approximately
2,100 lb, uncovering the JLS and opening the transfer valve. Tank 2 accepts fuel until its fuel quantity
reaches approximately 2,450 lb, covering the JLS and closing the transfer valve. Therefore, during
normal operation, Tank 2 fuel level cycles between 2,100 and 2,450 lb as long as transfer fuel is
available (JLS cycling).
Flapper valves in Tanks 1 and 4 provide a backup gravity transfer capability in certain circumstances. The flapper valve in Tank 4 is free flowing, gravity transferring to Tank 3 any time the Tank
4 fuel level is higher. Therefore, Tank 4 tends to keep Tank 3 full (near 2,600 lb) until the Tank 4 fuel
level drops below that of Tank 3 (wing tank fuel depleted). The flapper valve in Tank 1 is controlled
by left motive flow. The valve can be opened by the SDC following a Tank 1 transfer pump failure or
by loss of motive flow (left engine shutdown).
Since the Tank 4 transfer pump is not located on the bottom level of the tank, two motive flow
powered scavenge pumps, one routed to Tank 2 and the other to Tank 3, are installed to transfer the
last 300 lb of Tank 4. With empty transfer tanks, an excessive feed tank fuel split following symmetric
engine operation may indicate a Tank 4 scavenge pump failure. There is no SDC monitoring of the
Tank 4 scavenge pumps.
The Tank 1 and 4 transfer pumps are also used to dump fuel through the dump valve and to transfer
fuel to the ARS through the ARS replenishment valve.
2.2.2.1.1 Fuel Transfer Schedule/CG Control. The SDC implements a fuel transfer schedule (figure
2-4) designed to keep aircraft CG at an optimum location. The system periodically shuts off the Tank
1 transfer pump to keep Tank 1 and Tank 4 properly balanced. Fuel transfer scheduling operates until
Tank 4 drops below 300 lb or the FUEL LO caution comes on. When Tank 4 reaches 300 lb, Tank 1
should indicate 250 lb or below.
The FUEL XFER caution is set when Tank 1 and 4 fuel is not scheduling properly or wing tank
imbalance exceeds 350 lb. The caution is inhibited when the inflight refueling probe is extended.
2.2.2.2 Fuel Transfer - Internal Wing Tanks. Fuel is transferred from the wing tanks to Tank 4 by
two motive flow powered ejector pumps, one in each tank. When Tank 4 is less than full, the SDC opens
both wing motive flow control valves, which direct motive flow to the ejector pumps and transfer fuel
from the wing tanks to Tank 4. When Tank 4 is full, the motive flow control valves are closed and
normal wing transfer is inhibited.
If motive flow is lost on one side (single engine shutdown), the cross-motive shutoff valve opens so
that one motive flow system can power the ejector pumps in both wing tanks. If both motive flow
systems are lost, the wing tanks gravity transfer to Tank 4. Bank angle changes or a steady sideslip may
be required to gravity transfer all available wing fuel.
2.2.2.2.1 Wing Tank Balancing. The SDC incorporates wing tank balancing logic designed to keep
wing tank asymmetry below 200 lb. If wing tank asymmetry exceeds 200 lb, the SDC shuts off fuel
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-14 ORIGINAL
transfer from the lower tank by closing its wing motive flow control valve. If wing tank asymmetry
exceeds 350 lb for 15 seconds, the FUEL XFER caution appears.
Wing tank balancing also occurs during refueling, where the SDC alternately opens/closes the wing
refuel valves attempting to keep the wing tanks within 200 lb. The FUEL XFER caution is not set
during refueling. If SDC balancing logic cannot keep the wings from refueling asymmetrically (greater
than 350 lb), the FUEL XFER caution is set when the inflight refueling probe is retracted.
2.2.2.2.2 INTR WING Control Switch. The INTR WING control switch, located on the EXT LT
panel on the left console, is used to isolate the wing tanks (e.g., following battle damage).
INHIBIT Prevents normal transfer and refueling of the wing tanks (closes both wing motive
control valves, both wing refuel valves, and switches both diverter valves, located
in Tank 3, from the wing tanks to the feed tanks).
NORM Permits normal transfer and refueling of the internal wing tanks.
2.2.2.3 External Fuel Transfer. External fuel is transferred by regulated engine bleed air pressure
applied to all installed external tanks with WoffW. External tank pressurization is terminated for
inflight refueling (PROBE switch in EXTEND) and for arrested landing (both HOOK and LDG
GEAR handles down). With pressurization applied, external fuel transfer is controlled by the three
EXT TANKS transfer switches.
During external transfer, fuel is routed through the aircraft’s refuel/defuel line. Refuel valves in each
tank open only if commanded by the SDC and space is available. At MIL power and below, the SDC
Figure 2-4. Tank 1 and 4 Fuel CG Control and FUEL XFER Caution Schedule
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-15 ORIGINAL
only allows external fuel to transfer to Tank 1 and the wing tanks. In afterburner, the SDC allows
external fuel to transfer to any internal tank that can accept it.
NOTE
In Lots 21 - 25, SDC CG control logic (CG Restart) inhibits external
fuel transfer in flight and on deck with ORIDE selected until Tank 1
fuel quantity depletes to approximately 900 lbs. After external fuel
transfer begins, erroneous empty (<200 lbs) external fuel quantity
readings, which may occur during climbs/dives, can reinitiate CG
Restart logic inhibiting external fuel transfer until Tank 1 fuel
quantity depletes again to approximately 900 lbs. To initiate
immediate external fuel transfer in flight or to check external fuel
transfer on deck (i.e., override CG Restart logic), the IFR probe must
be extended for at least 25 seconds prior to retraction with at least one
EXT TANKS switch in ORIDE.
2.2.2.3.1 EXT TANKS Transfer Switches. The three EXT TANKS transfer switches are located on
the FUEL panel on the left console and are labeled LM/RM, LI/RI, and CTR (left and right midboard,
left and right inboard, and centerline tanks, respectively). With the external tanks pressurized, fuel
transfers when the FUEL LO caution is displayed regardless of the position of the EXT TANKS
transfer switches.
ORIDE Applies pressurization and transfers fuel from all external tanks whose switches are not
in STOP. May be used to transfer external fuel during extended ground operations
(EXT TANK caution). Overrides any SDC stop transfer command.
NORM Permits normal transfer and refueling of controlled external tank(s).
STOP Prevents transfer and refueling of controlled external tank(s) except with a FUEL LO
caution.
NOTE
• For ARS configured aircraft: If fueling of the ARS is not desired during
aerial refueling, as the receiver, CTR ORIDE must be selected since
CTR STOP will not prevent fuel from entering the ARS. Selecting
CTR ORIDE will pressurize all external fuel tanks and significantly
reduce refueling rate.
• If the ARS control panel is installed, centerline external tank transfer
is inhibited unless the STORE switch is in FROM. ORIDE on the CTR
EXT TANKS switch will have no effect.
2.2.3 Fuel Tank Pressurization and Vent. In Lots 21 thru 23, the internal fuel tank pressurization
system provides regulated engine bleed air pressure to all internal tanks to prevent fuel boil-off at
altitude. Bleed air pressure is applied to all internal tanks with WoffW. Pressurization is terminated
for inflight refueling (PROBE switch in EXTEND) and for arrested landing (both HOOK and LDG
GEAR handles down). In Lots 24 and up, internal tank pressurization is supplied by ram air only from
the vertical tail vents and no longer augmented by engine bleed.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-16 ORIGINAL
The vent system provides over-pressure and over-fill relief for the internal tanks. Pressurization is
applied to the vent lines in the two fuselage vent tanks. The vent lines connect all internal tanks and
are ported through the fuselage and vertical tail vent tanks to outlets located on the side of the vertical
tail. Normally, the vent lines contain only pressurized air; however, if a refuel valve failure overfills an
internal tank, fuel flows through the vent lines to the fuselage vent tanks. Two motive flow powered
vent tank scavenge pumps return this fuel from the fuselage vent tanks to the feed tanks.
Additionally, the vent system provides pressure relief of the internal fuel tanks during climbs and
vacuum relief during descents, if the pressurization system fails.
2.2.4 Thermal Management System. The thermal management system uses fuel from the high
pressure fuel stage of the motive flow/boost pump to cool the FADECs, liquid coolant, and AMAD and
hydraulic oils. The high pressure motive flow output of the pump has four branches.
The first branch is used to run motive flow powered pumps and valves in the fuel system. The second
branch directs cooling flow to the FADEC and exits into the fuel recirculation return line.
The third branch runs through the liquid coolant/fuel heat exchanger and the combined AMAD oil
and hydraulic oil/fuel heat exchanger in order to cool those fluids. A hot fuel diverter valve in the third
branch either directs fuel away from the engine and into the fuel recirculation return line or directs fuel
to the engines where it is combined with fuel feed from the motive flow/boost pump and burned.
Recirculated fuel first passes through a fuel/air heat exchanger bypass valve, which either directs the
fuel through or around the fuel/air heat exchanger. When sufficient recirculation fuel flow is present,
the SDC may open the heat exchanger bypass valve (Mach greater than approximately 0.35) to direct
hot fuel through the fuel/air heat exchanger. Then, the fuel passes through a diverter valve, located in
Tank 3, which either directs the fuel to the wing tanks or the feed tanks. Fuel directed to the wing tanks
then flows to Tank 4 for additional cooling. When Tank 4 is below 300 lb, recirculation fuel is returned
to the feed tanks by the Tank 4 scavenge pumps. When recirculation fuel is diverted to the wing tanks,
modulation of wing fuel quantities on cockpit fuel displays is noticeable at lower wing fuel levels.
The engine thermal control valve (TCV), located in the engine fuel control unit, maintains engine
combustor nozzle, engine lube oil, and aircraft accessories within their temperature limits. When the
system determines that more cooling is required (typically due to hot weather or low fuel levels), the
TCV opens, directing feed fuel into the recirculation return line. With the TCV open, greater cooling
flow is induced through the engine lube oil and aircraft accessory heat exchangers, and the FADEC,
ultimately reducing system temperatures.
The fourth branch runs to the cross cooling valve which opens following a motive flow system failure,
allowing one motive flow system to cool both FADECs and both engines’ accessories.
During ground operations, when temperatures exceed 40°C (30°C in LOT 26 and up), the liquid
coolant pump and Liquid Cooling System (LCS) ground cooling fan may be commanded on (if not
already on) to provide LCS cooling of the fuel system. In LOT 25 and below, the bypass valve, which
allows liquid coolant to the liquid coolant/fuel heat exchangers, is solely controlled by the liquid
coolant temperature, so the amount of fuel cooling provided (if any) depends on the temperature of
each fluid. In LOT 26 and up, the bypass valve is controlled by the ECS controller and will only direct
liquid coolant to the liquid coolant/fuel heat exchanger if the RADAR knob is in OFF.
NOTE
In LOT 26 and up, the RADAR knob must be in OFF in order to
provide any postflight LCS fuel cooling.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-17 ORIGINAL
In either case, placing the RADAR knob to OFF removes the radar as a heat source and should
extend ground operating time.
2.2.4.1 Fuel/Air Heat Exchanger. A fuel/air heat exchanger is located above each engine inlet, near
the leading edge. When the heat exchanger bypass valve is open, the heat exchanger uses inlet air to
provide additional fuel cooling. Air is drawn from the inlet through several banks of small pin holes
(bleed plates) and is exhausted through the spoiler opening on the upper surface of the LEX/fuselage.
2.2.4.2 Fuel/Air Heat Exchanger Leak Detection. Since a leak in the fuel/air heat exchanger can
result in engine fuel ingestion through the bleed plates, a leak detection system is incorporated. If a fuel
leak is detected during fuel/air heat exchanger operation, the SDC closes the heat exchanger bypass
valve and isolates the heat exchanger.
Leak detection logic is only capable of detecting a leak greater than approximately 400 pph in the
fuel air heat exchanger. Fuel flow through the heat exchangers is inhibited below approximately Mach
0.35 and anytime the ECS auxiliary scoops are deployed to guard against potential for engine inlet fuel
ingestion.
A leak of less than 400 pph can, however, be discovered during the post-flight switching valve checks.
Following engine shutdown, the SDC opens the cross cooling valve and the heat exchanger bypass valve
on the non-operating side for 20 seconds. If ground crew observe fuel exiting from the fuel/air heat
exchanger drainage ports (bottom, inboard edge of the inlet), a leak exists.
2.2.5 Refueling System. The aircraft can be refueled on deck through a single point refueling
receptacle or inflight through a hydraulically actuated inflight refueling probe. The refueling
receptacle is located behind door 8R on the forward right fuselage. The refueling probe is located on
the upper right side of the fuselage forward of the windscreen. A fuel pressure regulator/surge
suppressor is installed downstream of the refueling probe in order to control pressure spikes associated
with inflight refueling. Fuel from the single point receptacle or the refueling probe enters the
refuel/defuel line and is routed to all internal and external tanks. During refueling, the SDC opens all
refuel valves, allowing fuel to transfer into all internal tanks. External tank pressurization is
terminated when the probe is extended, allowing the refuel/defuel line to fill all installed external tanks
(EXT TANKS switch(es) not in STOP).
2.2.5.1 PROBE Switch. The guarded PROBE switch, located on the FUEL panel on the left console,
is used to extend and retract the inflight refueling probe.
EXTEND Extends the inflight refueling probe using HYD 2A pressure, energizes the probe
light (external lights master switch in NORM), and depressurizes all internal and
external tanks.
RETRACT Retracts the inflight refueling probe using HYD 2A pressure, deenergizes the probe
light, and repressurizes the internal and external tanks. The probe cannot be
retracted if HYD 2A pressure is not available.
EMERG
EXTD
Emergency extends the inflight refueling probe using either HYD 2B or APU accumulator pressure, energizes the probe light (external lights master switch in NORM),
and depressurizes all internal and external tanks.
2.2.6 Fuel Dump System. The fuel dump system allows all fuel except feed tank fuel to be dumped
overboard. The dump valve, controlled by the DUMP switch, is located in the Tank 1 and 4 transfer
line. With the dump valve open, the Tank 1 and 4 transfer pumps (high-speed setting) force fuel out
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-18 ORIGINAL
the dump outlet, located on the trailing edge of each vertical tail. Wing tank fuel is dumped by
transferring to Tank 4 with the INTR WING switch in NORM. External fuel is dumped by
transferring to Tanks 1 and 4 only with the EXT TANKS switch(es) in NORM or ORIDE.
NOTE
Anytime four external fuel tanks are loaded on wing stations (3, 4, 8,
and 9), selecting ORIDE on LI/RI external transfer switch will improve
dump performance and external transfer rate by commanding
simultaneous transfer of all external tanks vs. normal transfer sequence
(tanks on Stations 3/9 must be empty prior to tanks on Stations 4/8
transferring). Performing this function imposes airspeed limitations
defined in Figure 4-12.
Dump rate is typically in excess of two engine MAX power fuel flow, approximately 1,300 lb per
minute (78,000 pph). Fuel dumping continues until:
a. The DUMP switch is placed to OFF.
b. The BINGO caution comes on.
c. Tanks 1 and 4 are empty and all available fuel from internal wing and external tanks has been
depleted.
d. The FUEL LO caution comes on.
Simultaneous selection of fuel dump and afterburner during high AOA
maneuvering may ignite fuel and cause fuselage damage.
2.2.6.1 Fuel DUMP Switch. The lever locked fuel DUMP switch, located on the FUEL panel on the
left console, is spring loaded to the OFF position and electrically held in the ON position.
ON Opens the dump valve, allowing transfer tank and external tank fuel to be dumped.
The switch reverts to OFF with a BINGO or FUEL LO caution. With either caution,
holding the switch in the ON position with Tank 1 and/or 4 fuel available reinitiates
fuel dump.
OFF Dump valve closed
2.2.7 Fuel Quantity Indicating System. The fuel quantity indicating system measures the individual
fuel quantities in all internal and external fuel tanks and provides cockpit readouts for individual
tanks, total internal fuel, and total fuel onboard. Quantities are displayed on the EFD and the FUEL
display, rounded to the nearest 10 pounds (figure 2-5). Actual fuel tank probe readings are displayed
on the FUEL QTY display selected from the SUPT MENU/BIT/STATUS MONITOR display.
While the volume of fuel with full tanks does not change, the fuel quantities listed in pounds vary
with changes in temperature and fuel density. Full internal fuel quantity can vary from 13,250 to 15,960
lb for the F/A-18E or from 12,410 to 14,940 lb for the F/A-18F at fuel temperatures of 100° and -40°F,
respectively. Figure 2-5 lists standard day fuel quantities for JP-5, JP-8, and JP-4.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000

Figure 2-5. Fuel Quantity
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-20 ORIGINAL
2.2.7.1 EFD - Engine Fuel Display, Fuel Parameters. The EFD displays fuel, maintenance code, and
consumables information in green digits on a black background (figure 2-6). The top level EFD format
graphically displays total internal fuel, bingo level, and fuel quantities for up to five external fuel tanks.
The shaded regions of each graphic display the ratio of fuel available to fuel capacity. Digital readouts
of total fuel (large numbers), total INT fuel, external fuel tank quantities, and current BINGO setting
are also provided but are truncated to 100 lb increments.
The internal fuel format graphically displays only internal fuel tank quantities. Digital readouts of
feed tank fuel quantities are also provided, truncated to 100 lb increments.
During battery start of the engines, the EFD displays either three or five external fuel tanks if one
or more external fuel tanks are installed. For instance, if a full centerline tank is installed, the EFD
displays a full centerline graphic and 3.2 lb fuel. The inboard/midboard tanks appear empty reading
0.0 lb fuel. When the SMS completes startup BIT and initial inventory, the EFD displays only the
installed tank(s).
The aircraft fuel load can be checked on battery power by placing the ENG CRANK switch to L or
R, by starting the APU, or by resetting the MSP codes in the nose wheelwell. In the F/A-18F, the total
fuel load and the tank one fuel ratio will be in error, since the SDC defaults to F/A-18E settings while
on battery power. The total fuel load will appear 200 to 400 lb high, and the Tank 1 graphic (as
displayed on the internal format) will indicate approximately two-thirds when Tank 1 is, in fact, full.
When the MCs become operative with ac power applied, the total fuel load will be correct, and the EFD
will show the correct Tank 1 fuel ratio.
Bingo level is adjusted in hundred pound increments by rotation of the BINGO knob and thousand
pound increments by pull and rotation (clockwise is increasing). The MODE button toggles the EFD
between the top level and internal fuel formats. Pressing the MODE button for greater than 1.5
seconds selects the MSP format. With the MSP format displayed, the BINGO knob cycles between
MSP code pages if more than one is present. Pressing the MODE button again for greater than 1.5
seconds runs and displays the results of a consumables test. Subsequent actuation for less than 1.5
seconds returns to the last displayed top level or internal fuel format. Clockwise rotation of the BRT
knob increases the display’s brightness.
In the F/A-18F, the formats can be displayed on the aft EFD independently from the front EFD.
2.2.7.2 FUEL Display. The FUEL display (figure 2-7) is selected by the FUEL option on the SUPT
MENU. The FUEL display lists TOTAL fuel (internal and external), total INTERNAL fuel, the
available fuel in each tank, and the current BINGO setting. A moving caret is shown on the right side
of each tank, indicating the ratio of fuel available to tank capacity.
The SDC continuously monitors the validity of the fuel probes installed in each tank. If all probes
in a tank (except the feed tanks) are declared invalid, the SDC displays 0 lb fuel and the INV (invalid)
cue next to the tank. If one or more probes in a multi-probe tank are declared invalid, the SDC displays
the total of the valid probes only and the EST (estimated) cue next to the tank. If a feed tank fuel probe
is invalid, the SDC displays 1,125 lb (0 lb if the FUEL LO caution is set) and the EST cue. The TOTAL
and INTERNAL fuel values indicate the sum of all valid and estimated tank quantities with EST cues
(INV cues if any tank is INV).
The FLBIT option on the FUEL display is used to initiate a BIT of the fuel low level indicating
system. The FLBIT option remains boxed during BIT. A satisfactory test results in a FUEL LO
caution and voice alert within 13 seconds of BIT initiation. FLBIT cannot be initiated with a FUEL
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-21 ORIGINAL
LO caution set or an SDC failure. An SDC RESET option is provided to command an SDC software
reset.
2.2.7.3 F-QTY Advisory. The F-QTY advisory indicates an SDC or fuel quantity indicating system
failure which affects the accurate display of fuel quantity or CG information. The advisory is activated
when:
a. The MC loses communication with the SDC.
b. The SDC reports an internal or gauging system failure.
c. Any tank quantity is INV.
d. The SDC reports its output discretes are not working.
If a F-QTY advisory results from loss of MC communication with the SDC or the SDC reporting an
internal or gauging system failure, the MC is unable to report actual fuel quantities and the following
are displayed on the FUEL display (GLIM 7.5G caution):
Figure 2-6. Engine Fuel Display (EFD) - Fuel Parameters
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-22 ORIGINAL
a. All fuel quantities (except TOTAL) are held at their last displayed value.
b. TOTAL fuel is estimated by the MC based on the last valid fuel quantity and engine fuel flow.
c. A flashing ESTIMATED cue is displayed along with a minutes and seconds (XX:XX) timer
which indicates the duration since the displayed fuel quantities were last updated.
2.2.8 Fuel Low Level Indicating System. The fuel low level indicating system is completely
independent of the fuel quantity indicating system. When the fuel level in either feed tank drops to
approximately 1,125 lb, a FUEL LO caution, caution light, and voice alert are activated, and the
affected fuel tank quantity is displayed in inverse video on the EFD. If a low level indication was set
by a transient condition, such as prolonged negative g flight, the cautions remain on for 1 minute after
the low level indication is removed.
If the FUEL LO cautions are set, assume that at least one feed tank is
below approximately 1,125 lb regardless of displayed fuel quantity
indications.

2.3 FPAS - FLIGHT PERFORMANCE ADVISORY SYSTEM
NOTE
FPAS is functional in MC OFP H1E AND UP.
The flight performance advisory system (FPAS) is provided to aid the pilot in making time, fuel, and
distance calculations. Readouts for maximum range and maximum endurance are provided for three
flight conditions: current Mach and altitude, optimum Mach at the current altitude, and optimum
Mach and altitude. These three readouts can be used to adjust the aircraft flight profile to meet
mission requirements. Additionally, FPAS provides fuel remaining at arrival and recommended
distance to begin descent from the selected waypoint or TACAN station. Range, time, altitude, Mach,
and fuel are calculated by the FPAS algorithm and appear on the FPAS display.
2.3.1 FPAS Display. The FPAS display (figure 2-8) appears when the FPAS option is selected from
the SUPT MENU. The display is divided into five areas: the current range and endurance area, the
waypoint/TACAN steering area, the fuel flow area, the optimum range and endurance area, and the
default area. With engines running and WonW, only the optimum and default areas are valid. With
WoffW, all five areas are valid. Waypoint/TACAN steering information is provided with WoffW and
waypoint or TACAN steering selected (boxed) on the HSI display.
2.3.1.1 FPAS CURRENT RANGE and ENDURANCE. The CURRENT RANGE area displays three
calculations: the range in nautical miles TO 2000 LB fuel remaining at the current altitude and Mach,
the BEST MACH to fly at the current altitude to maximize range, and the range TO 2000 LB fuel
remaining if the BEST MACH is flown. If parameters used to calculate current range become invalid,
X’s replace the current range value, and an FPAS advisory replaces the current endurance value.
The CURRENT ENDURANCE area displays three calculations: the time in hours and minutes TO
2000 LB fuel remaining at the current altitude and Mach, the BEST MACH to fly at the current
altitude to maximize endurance, and the endurance TO 2000 LB fuel remaining if the BEST MACH
is flown. If parameters used to calculate current endurance become invalid, X’s replace the current
endurance value.
If IMN exceeds Mach 0.9, a MACH advisory replaces the current range value, and a LIM advisory
replaces the current endurance value. When total fuel drops below 2,500 lbs, the FPAS calculations
shift to 0 lbs remaining, and the TO 2000 LB legend changes to TO 0 LB.
2.3.1.2 FPAS Waypoint/Tacan Steering and the HSI Display. If waypoint or TACAN steering is
selected (boxed) on the HSI display, the selected waypoint or TACAN station is displayed under the
NAV TO legend, and the arrival time and fuel remaining at arrival (at the current flight conditions)
are displayed under the TIME and FUEL REMAIN legends, respectively.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-24 ORIGINAL
Fuel remaining at arrival and recommended distance to begin descent from the selected steering
source are displayed on the HSI display. If the recommended distance to begin descent is greater than
99 miles, 99 is displayed.
If FPAS waypoint/TACAN steering parameters become invalid, X’s replace the fuel remaining and
descent distance values. If IMN exceeds Mach 0.9, fuel remaining values are blanked. If fuel remaining
at the selected steering source is less than the TO 2000 LB or TO 0 LB legend, the WYPT number, the
TO 2000 (0) LB legend, and the fuel remaining value flash on the FPAS display and the fuel remaining
value flashes on the HSI display. If fuel remaining is calculated to be less than 0 lbs, 0 is displayed.
2.3.1.3 FPAS Fuel Flow. The total fuel flow rate (both engines) is displayed in pounds per nautical
mile under the LB/NM legend whenever the engines are running.
2.3.1.4 FPAS OPTIMUM RANGE and ENDURANCE. The OPTIMUM RANGE area displays three
calculations: the optimum ALTITUDE and MACH to fly to achieve the displayed maximum range TO
2000 LB. If parameters used to calculate optimum range become invalid, X’s replace the altitude,
Mach, and range values.
The OPTIMUM ENDURANCE area displays three calculations: the optimum ALTITUDE and
MACH to fly to achieve the displayed maximum endurance time TO 2000 LB. If parameters used to
calculate optimum range or optimum endurance become invalid, X’s replace the altitude, Mach, range,
and time values.
When total fuel onboard drops below 2,500 lbs, the FPAS calculations shift to 0 lbs remaining, and
the TO 2000 LB legend changes to TO 0 LB.
2.3.1.5 FPAS Default Area. If outside air temperature, stores drag, or fuel flow become invalid, the
TEMP, DRAG, or FF advisories are displayed next to the DEFAULT legend. These parameters, if
invalid, do not have a fatal impact on FPAS calculations.
2.3.2 FPAS CLIMB Option. The CLIMB option is available for selection in the NAV master mode.
Pressing the CLIMB option on the FPAS display enables the climb airspeed prompt, displayed above
the airspeed box in the HUD (HUD reject switch in the NORM position). When selected, CLIMB is
boxed and the climb airspeed prompt indicates the desired calibrated airspeed for an optimum climb
profile.
2.3.3 FPAS HOME Waypoint Selection. The HOME option arrows are used to increment/decrement
the home waypoint for use in FPAS fuel-on-deck (HOME FUEL caution) calculations. The selected
home waypoint is displayed above the HOME legend on the FPAS display. The home waypoint
defaults to 0 at power up and must be changed if another waypoint is desired (0 to 59). Decrementing
the home waypoint from 0 selects 59. If invalid parameters prevent FPAS from calculating the HOME
FUEL caution, the FPAS DDI advisory is displayed, the home waypoint is X’d, and the option arrows
are removed.
2.3.4 FPAS HOME FUEL Caution. When FPAS calculated fuel remaining at the selected home
waypoint reaches 2,000 lbs, the HOME FUEL caution is displayed. HOME FUEL caution logic is
disabled with WonW, the refueling probe extended, the landing gear cycled down then up, or within
5 seconds after a home waypoint change.

2.4 SECONDARY POWER SYSTEM
The aircraft secondary power system contains two airframe mounted accessory drives (AMAD) and
a single auxiliary power unit (APU). Figure 2-9 shows the major components of the secondary power
system.
2.4.1 AMAD - Airframe Mounted Accessory Drive. During normal operation, each AMAD is
mechanically driven by its corresponding engine through a power transmission shaft and is used to
drive a fuel boost/motive flow pump, an ac/dc electrical generator, and a 3000/5000 psi hydraulic pump.
Pneumatic pressure is used to rotate an air turbine starter (ATS) on each AMAD for engine crank/start
capability.
Figure 2-9. Secondary Power Supply
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-27 ORIGINAL
For ground maintenance use, either AMAD can be decoupled from its engine, allowing pneumatic
pressure to drive the AMAD and its accessories.
NOTE
Failure of the power transmission shaft (PTS) results in the display of
the associated GEN, BOOST LO, and both HYD circuit cautions.
2.4.2 APU - Auxiliary Power Unit. The APU is a small gas turbine engine used to generate a source
of air to power the ATS for normal engine start or to provide an alternate air source for the
environmental control system (ECS). The APU is located between the engines, with intake and exhaust
facing downwards.
The aircraft battery provides electrical power for APU ignition and start. A hydraulic motor powered
by the APU accumulator is used to start the APU. The APU receives fuel from the left engine feed line
upstream of the left engine feed shutoff valve. During normal operation, the APU shaft turns a
separate compressor which supplies air for main engine start or alternate ECS operation.
If an APU fire or overheat condition is detected on the ground, the APU fire extinguishing system
automatically shuts the APU down and, after 10 seconds, discharges the extinguisher bottle.
2.4.3 APU Switch. The APU switch, located on the left console, is spring loaded to the OFF position
and is electrically held in the ON position.
ON Automatic start and normal APU operation. The switch returns to OFF 1 minute after
the second aircraft generator comes online (BLEED AIR knob not in AUG PULL).
OFF Manual APU shutdown
To prevent an APU running engagement and to prevent APU exhaust
torching, a minimum of 2 minutes must elapse between APU shutdown
and another APU start.
2.4.3.1 APU READY Light. The APU READY light, located on the left console adjacent to the APU
switch, comes on when the APU has completed the start cycle and is capable of supporting engine
crank.
2.4.4 ATS Air Sources. Pneumatic pressure from one of three sources can be used to power the ATS
for engine crank/start: APU compressor air, opposite engine bleed air (crossbleed), or external air.
The APU compressor is the primary engine crank air source. With the APU online, the ECS air
isolation valve is closed and the ENG CRANK switch opens the desired air turbine starter control valve
(ATSCV), allowing APU compressor output to turn the ATS, AMAD, and engine core.
A crossbleed start can be utilized when one engine is operating and the APU is shutdown. The
operating engine should be set to a minimum of 80% N2 rpm to make sure bleed air output is sufficient
to crank the opposite engine. For a crossbleed start, the ENG CRANK switch opens the ECS air
isolation valve and the ATSCV, allowing compressor bleed air pressure to turn the ATS, AMAD, and
engine core. If one engine fails inflight and the engine core is rotating freely, crossbleed air may be used
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-28 ORIGINAL
to rotate the AMAD and retain some fuel, electrical, and hydraulic system output.
ATS exhaust may blister paint and cause possible door damage on the aft
underside of the fuselage during extended crossbleed operation of a failed
engine.
An external air source may also be used to start one or both engines. External air is applied to the
aircraft through a connection in the right main wheelwell. Both engine bleed air valves must be closed
(BLEED AIR knob OFF) to make sure that external air is the sole air source for engine start. For an
external air start, the ENG CRANK switch opens the ATSCV, allowing external air pressure to turn
the ATS, AMAD, and engine core.
2.4.4.1 ATS Protection. Each ATS has two sources of overspeed cutout protection. The primary
source is the corresponding generator, and the backup source is the frequency sensing relay (FSR). The
FSR monitors ATS speed and provides the signal which electrically holds the ENG CRANK switch.
When the generator comes on the line at 60% N2 rpm, it removes power from the ATSCV and the FSR,
which releases the ENG CRANK switch. If the primary cutout does not function (GEN switch OFF or
major generator malfunction), the FSR releases the ENG CRANK switch when it senses 63% N2 rpm.
Regardless of the engine start air source utilized, the corresponding GEN
switch should be ON, as the generator provides primary overspeed cutout
protection for the ATS.
2.4.4.2 ENG CRANK Switch. The ENG CRANK switch, located on the left console, is spring loaded
to the OFF position and is electrically held in the L or R position.
L Opens the left ATSCV and/or the ECS air isolation valve to direct pneumatic pressure
to the ATS for left engine crank.
OFF Closes both ATSCVs and the ECS air isolation valve. When the left or right generator
comes online following engine start, the switch automatically returns from L or R to the
OFF position.
R Opens the right ATSCV and/or the ECS air isolation valve to direct pneumatic pressure
to the ATS for right engine crank.
2.4.5 AUG PULL. During extended ground operations, APU compressor air may be used instead of
engine bleed air to run the ECS and cool the avionics (BLEED AIR knob in AUG PULL). AUG PULL
operation is discussed in the ECS section.
2.4.6 AMAD Related Cautions. The following AMAD related cautions are described in the Warning/
Caution/Advisory Displays in Part V:
• L or R OIL HOT • L or R AMAD PR • L or R ATS

2.5 ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM
The electrical power supply system consists of two generators, two transformer-rectifiers (TR), one
battery with dedicated battery charger, and a power distribution (bus) system (figure 2-10). Each
generator provides a primary ac source and three isolated dc sources from a permanent magnet
generator (PMG). During normal operation, the left generator powers only the left buses while the
right generator powers only the right buses. If one generator fails, the other generator is capable of
carrying the entire electrical load of the aircraft. Battery power is provided for normal engine start.
External electrical power can be applied to power the entire system on the ground. The bus system
consists of the left and right 115 vac buses, right 26 vac bus, left and right 28 vdc buses, 28 vdc essential
bus and a 28 vdc maintenance bus. See figure 2-10 for a simplified schematic and Electrical System,
foldout section, for the specific systems powered by each bus.
2.5.1 Electrical RESET Button. The electrical system RESET button is located on the electrical
power panel on the right console. This button provides master reset capability for any failed generator
or electrical system relay without interrupting operational circuits.
2.5.2 AC Electrical Power. The two generators are the primary source of ac electrical power. With the
GEN switch in NORM, each generator comes online at approximately 60%N2 rpm as long as voltage
and frequency are within limits. Each generator supplies ac power to an independent 115 vac bus. In
addition, the right 115 vac bus powers a 26 vac bus through a dedicated transformer.
2.5.2.1 GEN Switches. Two generator control switches, labeled L GEN and R GEN, are located on
the electrical power panel on the right console.
NORM Provides normal generator operation.
OFF Removes the generator ac source from the bus system.
2.5.2.2 Electrical Fault Protection Circuitry. The electrical system provides fault protection with
generator isolation, bus tie, generator automatic reset, and ac bus isolation circuitry.
If a generator fault occurs, generator isolation circuitry removes the affected generator from its buses
(L or R GEN caution and caution light). All generator faults except N2 underspeed require manual
generator reset (GEN switch cycled to OFF then NORM or RESET button pressed). Generator reset
is successful only if the out-of-tolerance or fault condition has cleared. If the generator fault remains,
bus tie circuitry allows the remaining generator to power all electrical buses. During an N2 underspeed
condition, the affected generator is automatically restored when rpm returns to normal range.
If a short or overload condition (bus or equipment fault) occurs on a bus (the R 115 vac bus, for
instance), the following sequence is initiated. The right generator attempts to power through the short
and, if unsuccessful, trips offline. The left generator is then connected to the right buses by the bus tie
circuitry, attempts to power through the short, and, if unsuccessful, also trips offline. Approximately
1 second after the dual generator outage, the generator automatic reset logic resets both generators. If
the bus or equipment fault has cleared, both generators remain online to power their respective buses.
If the bus or equipment fault remains, the right generator trips offline again, but bus isolation circuitry
now prevents the left generator from picking up the right buses (GEN TIE caution light). The left
generator remains online to power the left buses and the R 28 vdc bus. The R 115 vac bus, R 26 vac bus,
and battery charger are unpowered, and the battery runs the maintenance bus. This entire process may
take as long as 16 seconds.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-30 ORIGINAL
Figure 2-10. Simplified Electrical Schematic
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-31 ORIGINAL
For the ac bus isolation and generator automatic reset circuits to operate, the GEN TIE switch must
be in NORM, the BATT switch must be ON and the PARK BRAKE handle must not be set. With the
PARK BRAKE handle set, the generators do not reset following a dual outage.
2.5.2.3 GEN TIE Caution Light. During initial engine start (battery or external power) GEN TIE
circuitry requires a set PARK BRAKE handle to properly function. If the PARK BRAKE handle is not
set during right (first) engine start, a GEN TIE caution light comes on when the right generator comes
online. For a battery start, setting the PARK BRAKE handle and cycling the R GEN switch reties the
left and right buses and clears any avionics faults that would otherwise occur. For an external power
start, setting the PARK BRAKE handle, disconnecting external power, and cycling the GEN TIE
switch reties the left and right buses.
2.5.2.4 GEN TIE Switch. The red-guarded GEN TIE switch is located on the left console outboard of
the exterior lights panel.
RESET Resets the bus tie circuitry. Reset is accomplished by cycling the switch to RESET
then NORM.
NORM With the BATT switch ON, enables the bus tie, ac bus isolation and generator
automatic reset circuits.
If the left and right buses are isolated because of a detected fault (e.g., R
GEN caution and GEN TIE caution light), cycling the GEN TIE switch
reenergizes the faulty bus/equipment and may cause further damage or
loss of the remaining generator.
2.5.3 DC Electrical Power. DC electrical power is provided by two TRs, three dc outputs from each
PMG, the battery, and the battery charger.
2.5.3.1 TR - Transformer-rectifiers. While each TR is powered by its respective 115 vac bus, the
output of each TR is connected in parallel, powering both the left and right 28 vdc buses and providing
primary power for the essential bus. If one TR fails, the other powers the entire dc system. There is no
cockpit warning of a single TR failure (no caution and no MSP code). TR operation is checked on
maintenance phase inspections.
2.5.3.2 PMG - Permanent Magnet Generator. The PMG in each generator provides three dc sources,
two for FCC channels and one for essential bus backup. The left PMG provides the primary power
source for FCC A (channels 1 and 2), while the right PMG provides the primary power source for FCC
B (channels 3 and 4). Regardless of generator control switch position, the PMGs come online when the
engine reaches approximately 50% N2 rpm on spool up and remain on until 20% N2 rpm on spool
down.
2.5.3.3 Battery. The primary operational use of the battery is engine start. The battery powers the
maintenance bus directly, allowing operation of the canopy, ladder, and maintenance monitor in the
absence of ac electrical power. With the BATT switch ON (first engine start), the battery also powers
the essential bus. In the unlikely event of a total ac/dc failure inflight, the battery provides the last
level of essential bus backup capability, providing about 5 to 10 minutes of power for the FCCs, after
which aircraft control is lost.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-32 ORIGINAL
Regardless of BATT switch position, the battery charger supplies charging power to the battery
anytime the right 115 vac bus is energized.
2.5.3.4 FCC Electrical Redundancy. FCC electrical redundancy is provided by several sources of dc
power (figure 2-11). The primary dc source for each FCC channel is its respective PMG output. If a
PMG output should fail, that FCC channel is powered by the essential bus, which also has several
sources of redundancy (the TRs, the PMGs, and the battery). The BATT switch must be ON for either
a PMG or the battery to power the essential bus. Additionally, ‘‘keep alive’’ circuits connected directly
to the maintenance bus provide each FCC channel with an uninterrupted backup power source during
normal bus power transients.
2.5.3.5 BATT Switch. The BATT switch is located on the electrical power panel on the right console.
ON Allows the battery or either PMG to power the essential bus when TR power is not
available.
OFF Prevents the battery or either PMG from powering the essential bus when TR
power is not available.
2.5.3.6 Automatic Battery Cutoff. The automatic battery cutoff circuit is provided to conserve
battery power. On the ground with the BATT switch ON, the circuit disconnects the battery from the
essential bus and returns the BATT switch to OFF 2 minutes after ac power is removed from the
aircraft. When battery cutoff is activated, the battery can be reconnected to the essential bus by
reselecting the BATT switch ON. The automatic battery cutoff circuit is disabled when the APU comes
online.
2.5.3.7 Battery Gauge. A battery gauge is installed on the electrical power panel on the forward right
console in the front cockpit only. Depending on generator status, the battery gauge provides an
indication of either essential bus voltage (both GENs offline) or maintenance bus voltage (either GEN
online).
With both GENs offline and the BATT switch ON (e.g., prior to first engine start), the battery gauge
is connected to the essential bus and indicates battery voltage. Nominal voltage for a ″good″ battery
should be 23 to 24 vdc. Minimum battery voltage is that which provides a successful engine start (e.g.,
APU remains online and the EFD remains powered to provide indications of RPM and TEMP). EFD
blanking and/or uncommanded APU shutdown should be anticipated with battery voltage at or below
18 vdc.
With at least one GEN online, the battery gauge is connected to the maintenance bus and indicates
28 vdc output of the battery charger. If the battery gauge fails to jump to approximately 28 vdc with
one GEN online, a battery charger malfunction has occurred which requires maintenance action prior
to flight.
If a dual GEN failure occurs, the battery gauge is reconnected to the essential bus and must be
referenced to determine the essential bus power source. If the battery gauge remains at approximately
28 vdc, an EBB PMG is powering the essential bus, and FCC operating time is not limited. However,
if the battery gauge indicates 24 vdc or below, the battery is powering the essential bus, and FCC
operating time is limited to about 5 to 10 minutes. The FCCs should continue to operate down to a
battery gauge voltage of approximately 18 vdc.
2.5.3.8 BATT SW Caution and Caution Light. The BATT SW caution and caution light are only set
to alert the aircrew of an improperly placed BATT switch. The battery gauge must be referenced to
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-33 ORIGINAL
determine whether an EBB PMG or the battery is powering the essential bus following a dual GEN
failure. These cautions are set in only two circumstances.
1. The BATT switch is ON on the ground in the absence of ac power (e.g., first engine start). The
battery is depleting and the switch should be placed to OFF unless APU start is about to be made.
2. The BATT switch is OFF inflight and should be placed to ON to provide essential bus backup
capability from the PMGs and the battery.
2.5.4 External Electrical Power. External electrical power may be connected to the aircraft bus
system through an external power receptacle located on the left forward fuselage. If external power is
not of the proper quality, the external power monitor prevents application of power to the aircraft.
Actuation of 1 to 4 ground power switches is required to energize certain aircraft systems following
application of external power.
The aircraft buses are energized by external power in the same manner as if a generator were
operating provided the BATT switch is OFF or the PARKING BRAKE is set.
2.5.4.1 External Power Switch. The external power switch, located on the ground power panel on the
left console, is spring loaded to the NORM position (figure 2-12).
Figure 2-11. FCC Electrical Redundancy
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-34 ORIGINAL
RESET Momentary actuation allows external power to be applied.
NORM Aircraft buses are energized by external power, provided the switch was first positioned to RESET. The switch returns to OFF when external power is disconnected.
OFF Disconnects external power from the aircraft.
2.5.4.2 Ground Power Switches. The four ground power switches are located on the ground power
panel on the left console (figure 2-12). Each switch controls a group of systems and/or instruments, as
listed on a placard above the panel.
A ON Only systems/instruments listed for the A position are energized by external
power.
AUTO All controlled systems/instruments are deenergized with external power on the aircraft. When a generator comes online, the switch(es) automatically revert to
AUTO.
B ON All controlled systems/instruments (both A and B) are energized by external
power.
The first ground power switch placed to ON must be held for 3 seconds to complete an avionics
overheat BIT. If an avionics overheat condition is present, the switch(es) revert to AUTO and cannot
be returned to ON until the condition is corrected.

2.6.1.4 Formation Lights. Ten formation ″strip″ lights, five on each side of the aircraft, are provided
to highlight the aircraft aspect during night or low visibility formation flight. Strip lights are located
on the forward fuselage forward of the LEX, on the wingtip above the missile rail, on the wingtip below
the missile rail, on the aft fuselage below the vertical tail, and on the vertical tail. Each formation light
contains two lighting strips, one normal and one IR. The external lights master switch determines
which set of strips are powered by the FORMATION lights knob.
2.6.1.4.1 FORMATION Lights Knob. The FORMATION lights knob, located on the EXT LT panel
on the left console, is used to apply power and control the brightness of the formation strip lights. The
knob provides variable lighting intensity between the OFF and BRT positions in either the normal or
NVIS mode.
2.6.1.5 Approach Lights. The approach lights, located on the nose gear strut, provide AOA
indications to an LSO during carrier landings. Three approach lights are provided to indicate a fast
(red), on-speed (amber), or slow (green) AOA condition. The approach lights are powered with WoffW
and all landing gear down and locked. Therefore, the approach lights are an external indication that the

displays reset to DAY mode brightness with the mode switch in DAY or NITE positions, and to NITE
mode brightness with the mode switch in NVG position.
2.6.2.2 CONSOLES Lighting Knob. The CONSOLES lighting knob, located on the INTR LT panel,
is used to control the brightness of the integral lighting for the left and right consoles, the hydraulic
pressure gauge, and both circuit breaker panels. Clockwise rotation of the knob increases console
lighting intensity from the OFF to BRT positions. The CONSOLES knob and integral console lighting
are disabled in the NVG mode.
2.6.2.3 INST PNL Lighting Knob. The INST PNL lighting knob, located on the INTR LT panel, is
used to control the brightness of the integral lighting for the main instrument panel and the standby
magnetic compass. Clockwise rotation of the knob increases main instrument panel lighting intensity
from the OFF to BRT positions. The strobe function of the SHOOT light is disabled when the
instrument lights are on.
2.6.2.4 FLOOD Lights Knob. The FLOOD knob, located on the INTR LT panel, is used to control the
brightness of the white cockpit floodlights. Eight floodlights are provided for secondary lighting; three
above each console and one on either side of the main instrument panel. Clockwise rotation of the knob
increases floodlight intensity from the OFF to BRT positions. The FLOOD knob and all white
floodlights are disabled in the NVG mode. There is no brightness control for the six NVG floodlights.
2.6.2.5 CHART Light Knob. The CHART light knob, located on the INTR LT panel, is used to
control the brightness of the NVG compatible chart light. The chart light is located on the canopy bow
at the 10:30 position and rotates in two axes. Clockwise rotation of the knob increases chart light
intensity from the OFF to BRT positions.
2.6.2.6 Utility Floodlight. The utility floodlight, normally stowed above the right console, provides a
portable source of secondary lighting. An attached alligator clip allows the light to be fastened at
various locations in the cockpit. The light contains a knob which provides variable lighting intensity
from off to bright and a button which, when pressed, illuminates the light at full intensity. The light
also contains a rotary selector for white or NVG compatible green lighting.
2.6.2.7 Emergency Instrument Lights. The emergency instrument lights, located on the left and
right sides of the main instrument panel, illuminate the EFD and standby flight instruments in the
absence of ac electrical power. The lights come on anytime the PMGs or the battery are powering the

in the NITE and NVG modes.
Following a power interruption in either the DAY or NITE mode, the warning, caution, and advisory
lights default to the maximum brightness range. Following a power interruption in the NVG mode, the
warning, caution, and advisory lights remain in the reduced brightness range.
2.6.2.10 LT TEST Switch. The LT TEST switch, located on the INTR LT panel, is spring loaded to
the OFF position. The switch is used to test important cockpit lighting to verify bulb integrity prior to
flight. The switch requires ac electrical power to operate.
TEST Powers all operating warning, caution, and advisory lights, the AOA indexer lights, the
integral background lighting on the EFD (BINGO, MODE, and BRT), changes MENU
to ENG on the DDIs, provides a CHECK SEAT caution in the F/A-18E, and annunciates the landing gear warning tone.
OFF Lights test off
2.6.3 Interior Lighting (F/A-18F). All controls for the interior lights of the rear cockpit are located
on the INTR LT panel on the right console. The controls operate in the same manner as those in the
front cockpit with two exceptions. There is no MODE switch on the rear cockpit INTR LT panel, and
the rear cockpit LT TEST switch does not illuminate the AOA indexer lights or annunciate the landing
gear warning tone.
2.7 HYDRAULIC POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM
The hydraulic power supply system is a dual pressure system (3,000 and 5,000 psi). The aircraft uses
hydraulic power to actuate primary flight control surfaces and to run the following utility hydraulic
functions: landing gear, wheel brakes and anti-skid, hook, launch bar, refueling probe, nosewheel
steering (NWS), gun, and parking brake. Two hydraulic accumulators provide emergency hydraulic
power for critical utility functions.
2.7.1 Hydraulic System. The hydraulic power supply system incorporates two independent hydraulic systems, HYD 1 and HYD 2 (figure 2-16). Each system is divided into two branches providing four
independent hydraulic circuits identified as 1A and 1B for the left system and 2A and 2B for the right
system. HYD 1 circuits are dedicated solely to flight controls. HYD 2A powers both flight controls and
most utility hydraulic functions. HYD 2B powers the flight controls and arresting hook and pressurizes
both the APU and emergency brake accumulators.
All flight control surface actuators are powered by one HYD 1 circuit and one HYD 2 circuit, either
simultaneously or through hydraulic switching valves.
The utility system operates at 3,000 psi only. Two pressure reducers, one on HYD 2A and one on
HYD 2B reduce utility circuit pressure to 3,000 psi when pump output is 5,000 psi.

A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-43 ORIGINAL
2.7.1.1 Hydraulic Pumps. Each system is pressurized by a single, dual pressure (3,000 and 5,000 psi),
variable displacement pump mounted on an AMAD. Pump output pressure is commanded by the
FCCs based on aircraft flight condition; with 5,000 psi utilized during high-speed flight when air loads
are high. One pump is capable of powering the entire flight control system in the event of a single
system failure. A hydraulic pressure transducer relays system pressure to a hydraulic pressure gauge
in the cockpit. Hydraulic cautions (HYD 1A, HYD 1B, HYD 2A, HYD 2B) are set when individual
hydraulic pressure switches detect circuit pressure below 1,400 psi.
2.7.1.1.1 Hydraulic Pressure Gauge. The hydraulic pressure gauge is located on the lower right main
instrument panel. The gauge has individual needles for indicating HYD 1 and HYD 2 system pressure.
Tick marks for 3,000 and 5,000 psi are provided. Two white bands indicate the range of acceptable
operation pressure (2,600 to 3,300 psi and 4,500 to 5,400 psi). Since the gauge is ac powered, actual
hydraulic readings are not provided until the first generator is online following engine start. During
shutdown, pressure readings freeze when the last generator drops offline.
2.7.1.2 Hydraulic Reservoirs. Hydraulic fluid is supplied to each system by a separate hydraulic
reservoir. The HYD 2 reservoir is larger than the HYD 1 reservoir in order to accommodate the utility
system.
2.7.1.2.1 Reservoir Level Sensing (RLS) System. Each reservoir incorporates an RLS system,
designed to isolate a leak in either system circuit. When reservoir fluid level drops to approximately
50%, RLS shuts off circuit A (HYD 1A or HYD 2A caution). If fluid level continues to deplete to
approximately 30%, RLS restores circuit A and shuts off circuit B (HYD 1B or HYD 2B caution). If
alternate circuit shutdown fails to isolate the leak, RLS restores circuit B (no cautions) at approximately 15%, providing hydraulic pressure to both systems until fluid depletion (both cautions).
2.7.1.3 Switching Valves. Hydraulic switching valves are utilized to provide backup hydraulic power
to actuators that are not powered simultaneously by both systems. Two hydraulic circuits, a primary
and a backup, provide power to each switching valve.
2.7.1.3.1 Switching Valve Operation. Following a drop in primary circuit pressure (less than 900
(±100 psi)), the switching valve automatically shuts off the primary circuit and tests downstream
pressure to make sure its actuator(s) was not the leakage source which caused the primary circuit loss.
Concurrently, FCC monitoring detects the pressure loss and inhibits FCC actuator failure detection
logic for 10 seconds to allow the switching valve time to function.
If the actuator(s) passes this leak detection test, the switching valve allows the backup circuit to
provide hydraulic power. If the actuator(s) fails the test, the switching valve isolates both circuits to
prevent additional loss of the backup circuit. At the expiration of the 10 second timer, the FCCs no
longer inhibit actuator failure detection logic. With both circuits isolated, this logic Xs LEF actuators
immediately and rudder or aileron actuators only when the actuator is subsequently commanded to
move. It is for this reason that the FLAP switch is cycled during the post-flight switching valve check.
Switching valve operation is completely hydro-mechanical, separate from electrical inputs or FCS
reset commands. As mechanized, there is no hazard associated with multiple reset attempts to regain
an Xd surface following a hydraulic circuit failure.
Preference is given to the primary circuit at all times. The switching valve transfers to the primary
circuit any time primary circuit pressure recovers above 2,000 psi, regardless of the valve position or the
backup circuit pressure level.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-44 ORIGINAL
NOTE
If the leak detection test failed due to cavitation in the actuator, the
switching valve resets, runs another test, and completes the switch to
the backup circuit. This self-resetting feature may require several
minutes to complete depending on surface loading, hydraulic system
pressure, and system temperature. In this case, an FCS reset restores
an X’d surface if and when the switching valve successfully transfers to
the backup circuit.
2.7.1.4 Hydraulic Isolation Valves. HYD 2 utility functions that are required only during takeoff,
landing, and ground operations are downstream of isolation valves. The forward isolation valve is
closed when the LDG GEAR handle is UP and all three landing gear are up and locked; isolating the
nose gear, NWS, launch bar, wheel brakes, and anti-skid. The aft isolation valve and the arming valve
are open with WonW and are normally closed inflight; isolating arresting hook retraction, parking
brakes, and emergency brakes. The aft isolation valve is manually opened inflight by hook retraction
or by holding the HYD ISOL switch in ORIDE. The arming valve is manually opened inflight by
emergency gear or emergency probe extension.
2.7.2 Hydraulic Accumulators. Two hydraulic accumulators are provided in the HYD 2B circuit; the
auxiliary power unit (APU) accumulator and the brake accumulator.
The APU accumulator provides hydraulic pressure to start the APU. With a HYD 2 failure, pressure
from the APU accumulator can be used to:
a. Emergency extend the landing gear or refueling probe inflight.
b. Provide emergency nosewheel steering on the ground.
c. Aid the brake accumulator with emergency braking.
On the ground with engines shutdown, the brake accumulator provides hydraulic pressure to set the
parking brake. With a HYD 2 failure, pressure from the brake accumulator can be used to provide
emergency braking. A fully charged brake accumulator provides a minimum of ten full brake
applications.
The APU and brake accumulator charges are maintained against normal leakage and temperature
fluctuations by a trickle-charge restrictor connected to HYD 2A. Additionally, both accumulators may
be manually recharged inflight using HYD 2B pressure by placing the HYD ISOL switch to ORIDE.
This procedure recharges the brake accumulator if and only if the arming valve is open (emergency gear
or emergency probe extension previously selected). Both accumulators can be charged on the ground
by a hand pump located in the right main landing gear wheelwell.
2.7.2.1 Brake Accumulator Pressure Gauge. The brake accumulator pressure gauge is located on
the lower left main instrument panel and is redlined to indicate pressure below 2,000 psi. The BRK
ACCUM caution is displayed when brake accumulator pressure drops below 2,000 psi. The caution and
redlined pressure indication are warnings that approximately five full brake applications remain before
the brake accumulator is empty. When ac power is not applied, power to the gauge is controlled by the
BRK PRESS switch.
2.7.2.1.1 BRK PRESS Switch. The BRK PRESS switch, located on the forward left console, is spring
loaded to the aft position.

2.7.2.2 HYD ISOL Switch. The HYD ISOL switch, located on the aft left console, is spring loaded to
the NORM position.
ORIDE Opens the aft isolation valve in flight allowing HYD 2B pressure to recharge the
brake and/or APU accumulators. Following emergency landing gear extension, the
switch may need to be held for up to 20 seconds to remove the APU ACCUM caution and provide a full charge (up to 40 seconds following an in-flight APU start).
NORM Allows normal aft isolation valve functioning.
If an APU ACCUM caution appears in flight and is not related to
emergency gear/probe extension or APU start, it may indicate a possible
leak in the isolated HYD 2B system. A BRK ACCUM caution in flight is
not normal and may indicate a possible leak in the isolated HYD 2B
system.
2.7.3 Hydraulic System Related Cautions and Caution Light. The following hydraulic system
related cautions and caution light are described in the Warning/Caution/Advisory Displays in Part V:

2.8 UTILITY HYDRAULIC FUNCTIONS
The utility hydraulic functions are powered by HYD 2 and include landing gear extension and
retraction, nosewheel steering, wheel braking and anti-skid, launch bar extension, arresting hook
retraction, and in-flight refueling probe extension and retraction. Operation of the in-flight refueling
probe is described in the Fuel System section.
2.8.1 Landing Gear System. The landing gear is a tricycle design and includes a nose landing gear
with steerable nosewheel and two fixed main landing gear. The nose landing gear retracts forward,
while the main landing gear retract aft and inwards. When the landing gear is extended, all landing gear
doors remain open.
2.8.1.1 Planing Links. Each main landing gear assembly incorporates a planing link, which is
designed to properly align the main wheels after landing gear extension. The joint which connects the
wheel to the main landing gear lever is designed to rotate off-axis, so that the wheel fits properly into
the main landing gear wheelwell. The planing link rotates the main wheel from its stowed orientation,
aligns it with the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, and locks over-center. A planing link proximity
switch is used to verify proper planing link position and thereby proper wheel alignment. A flashing
main landing gear position light is used to provide an indication of a planing link failure.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-46 ORIGINAL
2.8.1.2 Normal Landing Gear Extension and Retraction. Normal landing gear extension and
retraction is electrically controlled by the LDG GEAR handle and uses hydraulic pressure from HYD
2A. With weight off the nose gear and the launch bar retracted, moving the LDG GEAR handle to the
UP position sends an electrical signal to the landing gear selector valves to initiate normal landing gear
retraction. Likewise, moving the LDG GEAR handle to the DN position sends an electrical signal to the
landing gear selector valves to initiate normal landing gear extension
If the launch bar does not return to the up and locked position after catapult launch or the nose gear
indicates WonW, the nose landing gear cannot be retracted. In either case, placing the LDG GEAR
handle UP will raise the main landing gear and leave the nose landing gear extended.
2.8.1.3 Emergency Landing Gear Extension. Emergency landing gear extension is mechanically
controlled by the LDG GEAR handle (front cockpit) or the EMERG LDG GEAR handle (rear cockpit
Lots 21 thru 25) and uses hydraulic pressure provided by the APU accumulator. Both handles are
mechanically connected to the landing gear emergency selector valves by a series of levers and cables.
Emergency extension is mechanically activated by rotating the LDG GEAR handle 90° clockwise and
pulling to detent (approximately 1.5 inches) or by pulling the EMERG LDG GEAR handle to the
detent.
Emergency landing gear extension opens the hydraulic arming valve and directs APU accumulator
pressure to the emergency selector valves. APU accumulator pressure is used to unlock the doors,
release the landing gear uplocks, and is applied to the drag brace locking actuator and sidebrace
downlock actuator. The nose landing gear extends by freefall aided by airloads and the drag brace
locking actuator. The main landing gear extends by freefall aided by the sidebrace downlock actuator.
Emergency extension can be performed with the LDG GEAR handle either UP or DN (DN is
recommended).
2.8.1.4 LDG GEAR Handle. The wheel-shaped LDG GEAR handle, located on the lower left main
instrument panel in the front cockpit, is used to control landing gear extension and retraction. A
downlock solenoid in the LDG GEAR handle assembly prevents gear retraction with WonW by
preventing movement of the handle from the DN position.
UP With WoffW and the launch bar retracted, electrically initiates normal
landing gear retraction.
DN Electrically initiates normal landing gear extension.
Emergency
(Rotate handle 90°
clockwise and pull
to the detent)
Mechanically initiates emergency landing gear extension.
2.8.1.5 DOWNLOCK ORIDE Button. The DOWNLOCK ORIDE button, located on the lower left
main instrument panel outboard of the LDG GEAR handle, is used to override the downlock solenoid.
If the downlock solenoid does not retract with WoffW (LDG GEAR handle cannot be moved from the
DN position), a failure has occurred in the downlock circuitry (Landing Gear Control Unit). If the
landing gear indicate three down and locked, cycling the landing gear handle is not recommended, as
proper landing gear functioning is questionable. However, if dictated by an emergency situation,
pressing and holding the DOWNLOCK ORIDE button will retract the mechanical stop and allow the
LDG GEAR handle to be moved to the UP position.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-47 ORIGINAL
The LDG GEAR handle must be in the full down position for the mechanical stop to properly engage
after landing (WonW).
If the DOWNLOCK ORIDE button is pressed or the mechanical stop is
not fully engaged, the LDG GEAR handle can be raised on the ground,
and the main landing gear will retract. The nose gear will not retract with
weight on the nose gear.
2.8.1.6 EMERG LDG GEAR Handle (F/A-18F). The EMERG LDG GEAR handle is located on the
lower left main instrument panel in the rear cockpit. Pulling the handle to the detent mechanically
initiates emergency landing gear extension.
2.8.1.7 Landing Gear Control Unit (LGCU). The LGCU monitors the position of the landing gear and
launch bar systems, provides cockpit indications of gear/launch bar position, and provides outputs to
various aircraft systems which are dependent on gear position (e.g., FCC A and B, the SMS, and the
SDC). The LGCU does not control landing gear extension and retraction.
The LGCU receives inputs from the LDG GEAR handle, the LAUNCH BAR switch, and the
following proximity switches: launch bar, landing gear uplocks, landing gear downlocks, planing links,
and WonW. The LGCU controls the red and green L BAR warning/advisory lights, the landing gear
position lights, the light in the gear handle, the landing gear warning tone, the downlock solenoid, and
all inputs to the FCCs and the SMS. The LGCU also performs a self-BIT and a functional check of all
proximity switches, providing MSP code input to the SDC.
2.8.1.8 Landing Gear Warning Light and Warning Tone. The landing gear warning light is a red light
located inside the LDG GEAR handle. The landing gear warning tone is a beeping tone heard in the
headset. The landing gear warning light and warning tone serve three purposes: to indicate a mismatch
between LDG GEAR handle position and actual gear position, to warn of a planing link failure, and to
provide a ″wheels warning.″
A steady warning light comes on whenever the landing gear is in transit and remains on until all
three gear are down and locked (LDG GEAR handle DN) or all gear doors are closed and locked (LDG
GEAR handle UP). If the landing gear is unsafe, the landing gear warning light remains on. The
warning tone is inhibited for 15 seconds to allow for normal landing gear extension and retraction. If
the warning light remains on for 15 seconds, the warning tone is annunciated to provide an aural
indication of unsafe landing gear position.
If a left or right planing link failure occurs with the landing gear down and locked (planing link
proximity switch not properly activated), the landing gear warning light will come on immediately
accompanied by the warning tone.
Lastly, when the LDG GEAR handle is UP, a flashing warning light accompanied by the warning
tone will be activated when airspeed is below 175 KCAS, altitude is less than 7,500 feet, and rate of
descent is greater than 250 fpm. This ″wheels warning″ is provided as a cue to check the position of the
landing gear at flight conditions where the LDG GEAR handle should normally be DN. The wheels
warning is also activated if calibrated airspeed and/or barometric altitude data are lost. In this case, the
standby airspeed and/or altitude indicators should be referenced prior to silencing the warning tone.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-48 ORIGINAL
2.8.1.8.1 WARN TONE SIL Button. The WARN TONE SIL button, located to the left of the LDG
GEAR handle, is used to silence the landing gear warning tone.
2.8.1.8.2 Landing Gear UNSAFE Light (F/A-18F). The landing gear UNSAFE light is a red light
located on the upper left main instrument panel in the rear cockpit. The light indicates a mismatch
between LDG GEAR handle position and actual gear position (e.g., gear in transit). The light does not
illuminate for a planing link failure, wheels warning, or loss of air data.
2.8.1.9 Landing Gear Position Lights. Three green landing gear position lights, located on the lower
left main instrument panel, are labeled NOSE, LEFT, and RIGHT. When the LDG GEAR handle is
DN, steady lights indicate that the corresponding landing gear is down and locked. The LEFT and
RIGHT landing gear position lights are also used to indicate a planing link failure. If the main landing
gear are down and locked but a planing link proximity switch is not properly activated, the
corresponding position light will flash.
A landing gear position of three down and locked is indicated by three steady green position lights
with the landing gear warning light out. Additionally, when illuminated inflight, the approach lights
provide an external indication that the landing gear is down and locked.
If a landing gear position light is out with the LDG GEAR handle DN and the landing gear warning
light out, a LT TEST should be performed to test the integrity of the position light bulb. If the bulb
tests bad, it is safe to assume that the gear is down and locked. During day operations, if all three
position lights appear to be out/dim, make sure the interior lights MODE switch is in the DAY position.
A landing gear position of three up and locked is indicated by the landing gear warning light out with
all three position lights out.
If one or more landing gear indicates unsafe, a visual inspection can only
confirm general position and obvious damage. There is no external
indication of a locked landing gear.
2.8.1.9.1 Landing Gear Position Lights (F/A-18F). Three green landing gear position lights, labeled
NOSE, LEFT, and RIGHT, are located on the upper left main instrument panel in the rear cockpit.
These lights have the same functionality as those in the front cockpit.
2.8.2 Nosewheel Steering System (NWS). The NWS system is used to provide directional control
and shimmy damping during ground operations. The NWS hydraulic power unit, attached to the nose
landing gear strut, is electrically controlled by commands from the FCCs and is hydraulically actuated
by pressure from HYD 2A (primary) or HYD 2B/ APU accumulator (backup). In the event of a HYD
2A failure, a pressure-biased shuttle valve routes HYD 2B pressure (if available), or APU accumulator
pressure to the NWS unit for backup operation. The FCCs accept input from the rudder pedals to
provide NWS commands.
The NWS system has two modes, NWS (low) and NWS HI. In the low mode (NWS cue in the HUD),
full rudder pedal deflection commands approximately 22.5° of nosewheel deflection. In the high mode
(NWS HI cue in the HUD), full rudder pedal deflection commands approximately 75° of nosewheel
deflection. The NWS system (low gain) incorporates a yaw rate feedback input from the FCCs, which
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-49 ORIGINAL
is designed to suppress directional PIO tendencies by increasing directional damping during takeoff
and landing roll.
With loss of yaw rate information to the FCCs, directional PIO may occur
during aggressive ground tracking.
If the NWS system fails, the NWS caution is displayed and the NWS or NWS HI cue is removed
from the HUD. When failed, the NWS system reverts to a 360° free-swiveling mode.
2.8.2.1 NWS Engagement/Disengagement. With WonW, manual NWS engagement is provided by
actuation of the NWS/undesignate button. The method required to engage each of the two NWS
modes (low and high) is dependent on wing lock/unlock status.
With the wings spread and locked and NWS disengaged, the first momentary press and release of the
NWS button engages full-time NWS (low). NWS HI is engaged by subsequent press and hold of the
NWS button. With NWS disengaged, press and hold for greater than 1 second also engages NWS HI.
If the NWS button is released, the system reverts to NWS (low).
With the wings unlocked and NWS disengaged, the first momentary press and release of the NWS
button still engages full-time NWS (low). However, subsequent press and release engages full-time
NWS HI, providing hands-free NWS HI capability for operations in the carrier environment. If the
wings are subsequently spread and locked, NWS reverts to the low mode.
During landing, full-time NWS (low) is automatically engaged when the nose landing gear and at
least one main landing gear transition to WonW. If NWS is engaged with both HYD 2A and 2B failures,
the NWS or NWS HI cue will flash in the HUD as an indication that APU accumulator pressure is
depleting.
NWS is manually disengaged by pressing the paddle switch. NWS is automatically disengaged for
catapult launch, when the launch bar is extended. With the launch bar extended, NWS (low) can be
momentarily engaged to position the launch bar by press and hold of the NWS button. Additionally,
NWS is automatically disengaged when the nose landing gear transitions to WoffW during takeoff or
when power is removed from the FCCs.
2.8.2.2 Emergency High Gain NWS. With a FCS CH 2 or FCS CH 4 failure, normal nosewheel
steering is lost. Emergency high gain NWS can be regained by pulling the failed channel circuit
breaker, unlocking the wings, and momentarily pressing the nosewheel steering button.
When emergency high gain NWS mode is entered, NWS indications may
not be displayed on the HUD. As a result, inadvertent nosewheel steering
actuation may injure ground personnel.
2.8.3 Wheel Brake System. The aircraft’s wheel brake system provides normal braking, anti-skid,
emergency braking, a parking brake, and main wheel anti-spin. Normal braking utilizes HYD 2A
pressure and is capable of functioning with a separate anti-skid system. The anti-skid system, when
enabled, provides maximum braking effectiveness on wet runways or during heavy braking by
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-50 ORIGINAL
preventing wheel skid. When selected, emergency braking utilizes HYD 2B pressure, if available, or
brake and APU accumulator pressure to provide backup braking capability following a HYD 2A
failure. The anti-spin function stops main landing gear wheel rotation prior to landing gear retraction.
2.8.3.1 Wheel Brake Assembly. Each main landing gear wheel is fitted with hydraulically actuated
multiple disk brakes. There are two independent sets of brake lines running to each wheel brake
assembly: the normal brake line pressurized by HYD 2A and the emergency brake line pressurized by
HYD 2B or the brake and APU accumulators. See figure 2-17. Only one set of brake lines can be
pressurized at any given time. A shuttle valve on each wheel brake assembly switches from normal to
emergency brake pressure, depending on which is applied.
Each wheel brake assembly has a brake wear indicator pin, located on the inboard side of the wheel.
When the brakes are applied and the indicator pin is flush or below flush with the brake housing, the
brake pads require changing.
Each wheel assembly incorporates a fuse plug which is designed to melt and deflate the tire at
temperatures below those which would result in a catastrophic tire blowout.
2.8.3.2 Wheel Brake Operation. Each main wheel brake is controlled by a separate brake pedal,
integrated into the rudder/brake pedal mechanism. Pilot applied force to the top of each brake pedal
is transmitted by a series of cables and pulleys directly to the brake control hydraulic servovalves,
located in the nose wheelwell. The amount of hydraulic pressure applied to the wheel brakes by the
servovalves is directly proportional to brake pedal force. Dual brake pedal action provides symmetric
braking, while individual brake pedal action provides differential braking. In the F/A-18F (trainer
configuration), a second set of cables are routed to the servovalves from the rear cockpit brake pedals.
The servovalves are controlled by the pilot applying the most brake pedal force.
2.8.3.3 Normal Braking. Normal braking is enabled when HYD 2A is operable and the EMERG
BRK handle(s) are in the stowed position. The emergency brake valve is closed and the emergency
brake lines are unpressurized. During normal braking, HYD 2A pressure is applied through the left and
right servovalves proportional to the amount of pilot applied brake pedal force and is routed to the
main wheel brakes. When the ANTI SKID switch is ON, the anti-skid system modulates pilot applied
brake pressure in order to prevent wheel skid. When the ANTI SKID switch is OFF, the pilot must
regulate brake pedal force to prevent wheel skid.
2.8.3.4 Anti-skid System. The anti-skid system performs 4 basic functions which are designed to
maximize braking effectiveness during landing rollout: touchdown protection, wheel spin-up override,
skid control, and locked wheel protection. The anti-skid system is enabled when the ANTI SKID
switch is ON and the LDG GEAR handle is DN.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-51 ORIGINAL
Failure of either wheel speed sensor can lead to an anti−skid failure,
resulting in a complete loss of brakes. Placing the ANTI SKID switch to
the OFF position or pulling the EMERG BRK handle will bypass the
faulty system and restore braking ability. Judicious braking must be
used, as the anti−skid system is not available. Refer to the BRAKE
FAILURE/EMERGENCY BRAKES procedure.
The system contains two wheel speed sensors, an anti-skid control unit, and an anti-skid control
valve. The anti-skid control unit senses wheel speed and operates by electronically limiting the amount
of HYD 2A pressure that is applied to the wheel brakes through the anti-skid control valve and the
normal brake lines. Anti-skid is not available when emergency brakes are selected.
Touchdown protection delays initial brake application on landing by completely dumping brake
pressure until (1) weight is on the right main landing gear and wheel speed is over 50 knots or (2), if
a wet runway delays wheel spin-up, for 3 seconds after landing. This function prevents landing with
locked main wheels (tire blowouts) even if full brake pedal force is applied at touchdown.
Wheel spin-up override is activated at 50 knots wheel speed to allow normal braking if the right
WonW switch fails.
Figure 2-17. Wheel Brake and Anti-skid System
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-52 ORIGINAL
Skid control is enabled when sensed wheel speed differs from what the anti-skid control unit
determines it should be (e.g., hydroplaning is detected). If the system detects wheel skid, anti-skid
limits the amount of HYD 2A pressure applied to both brakes as required to prevent skidding. If no
skid exists, full pilot-applied brake pressure is routed to the brakes.
If the speed of one wheel drops 40% below the other wheel, locked wheel protection dumps brake
pressure to both wheels until the speed of the slower wheel returns above 40% of the other. Locked
wheel protection is removed below 35 knots, so that full braking performance (including locking a tire)
is available for taxi and turning operations. Below 14 knots, anti-skid is completely disabled. Below 35
knots, judicious braking is required to avoid flat spotting tires.
Anti-skid protection is bypassed when the ANTI SKID switch is OFF. Normally limited by the
anti-skid system, 3,000 psi hydraulic brake pressure is available and regulated only by pilot brake pedal
forces. When using brakes at high speed without anti-skid protection, there is a very small margin
between effective braking and blown tires. Any force greater than approximately 55 to 60 lbs applied
to the pedals (6° to 7° of pedal rotation) will likely result in blown tires with either the ANTI SKID
switch OFF or emergency brakes selected. The use of normal (anti-skid off) brakes at high speed
should be done with extreme caution. If braking without anti-skid is needed at high speeds, initially
apply very light brake pedal pressure and gradually increase as required.
Use of brakes without anti-skid at high speed can result in blown tires
resulting in loss of directional control. If practical, rollout speed should be
as slow as possible before applying brake pedal pressure.
NOTE
Hot brakes and/or melted wheel assembly fuze plugs can be expected
any time maximum effort braking is used at heavy gross weights with
or without anti-skid, e.g., aborted takeoff or heavy weight landing
(above 46,000 lb GW) with high taxi brake usage.
2.8.3.4.1 ANTI SKID Switch. The ANTI SKID switch, located on the lower left main instrument
panel, is used to manually disable the anti-skid system, e.g., for carrier operations or following an
anti-skid failure (ANTISKID caution displayed). The switch is lever-locked in the OFF position.
ON Anti-skid system enabled for use with normal braking.
OFF Anti-skid system disabled (SKID advisory displayed when the landing gear is
down).
2.8.3.4.2 Anti-skid BIT and the ANTISKID Caution. The anti-skid control unit performs two types of
BIT: initiated and periodic. IBIT is performed when power is initially applied to the anti-skid system:
(1) when the landing gear is lowered, (2) when the ANTI SKID switch is selected from OFF to ON
inflight, or (3) on the ground with the parking brake set. IBIT performs a complete test of the anti-skid
system 9 seconds after power is applied and runs for 4.5 seconds. With WonW, IBIT is inhibited with
the parking brake released, as wheel motion will cause a false BIT failure and brake pressure would be
dumped if brakes were applied. PBIT only performs a partial anti-skid test and runs whenever power
is applied and IBIT is not running.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-53 ORIGINAL
If an anti-skid failure is detected by either BIT, the ANTISKID caution will be displayed at BIT
completion. If an anti-skid failure is detected by PBIT, cycling the ANTI SKID switch will command
an IBIT and a more complete test of the system. When IBIT is running, the ANTISKID caution is
inhibited or is removed if previously displayed. If the ANTISKID caution returns after IBIT, the
ANTI SKID switch must be placed to OFF in order to isolate the failure and make sure that normal
braking (without anti-skid) is available.
For instance, assume the right wheel speed sensor has failed and an ANTISKID caution is displayed.
If the ANTI SKID switch is left ON during landing, touchdown protection circuitry will dump and
never restore brake pressure to both wheels. Normal braking will be lost. In this case, placing the ANTI
SKID switch to OFF will restore normal braking (without anti-skid), or pulling the EMERG BRK
handle will enable emergency braking (bypassing anti-skid).
• Do not cycle the ANTI SKID switch in response to an ANTISKID
caution immediately prior to landing. Cycling the ANTI SKID switch
removes the ANTISKID caution for up to 13.5 seconds as the system
performs IBIT even though the anti-skid system may still be failed
and, if the system is not failed, wheel motion at touchdown may cause
a false BIT failure and a dump of normal brake pressure when brakes
are applied.
• If the ANTI SKID switch is not placed to OFF with an ANTISKID
caution displayed, normal braking capability may be lost completely.
2.8.3.5 Emergency Braking. Emergency braking is enabled when either EMERG BRK handle is
pulled to detent. This action opens the emergency brake valve and applies backup hydraulic pressure
to the hydraulic servovalves. If available, backup pressure from HYD 2B is utilized through the aft
isolation and arming valves, which are open with WonW. If HYD 2 is failed completely, backup
pressure from both the brake and APU accumulators is used. Check valves are incorporated to prevent
the loss of accumulator pressure if HYD 2B is failed. With backup pressure applied, the servovalves
isolate HYD 2A pressure, if still available, so that the normal brake lines are unpressurized.
During emergency braking, backup pressure is applied through the left and right servovalves
proportional to the amount of pilot applied brake pedal force and is routed to the main wheel brakes
through the emergency brake lines. These lines bypass the anti-skid control valve, so the pilot must
regulate brake pedal force to prevent wheel skid.
Hydraulic accumulators and the brake accumulator pressure gauge are discussed in the Hydraulic
Power Supply System section.

2.8.3.5.1 EMERG BRK Handle (Front Cockpit). The EMERG BRK handle is combined with the
PARK BRK handle and is located on the lower left main instrument panel in the front cockpit. When
the handle is in the stowed, emergency position (horizontal), the ‘‘EMERG’’ label appears upright. See
figure 2-18. To select emergency brakes, the handle must be pulled to the detent while in the horizontal
position.
Stowed
(unmarked)
Emergency brake valve closed. Normal braking selected.
PULL
(to detent)
Emergency brake valve open. Emergency braking selected.
The position of the EMERG BRK handle is the only indication that
emergency braking is selected: no warning or caution is displayed. The
EMERG BRK handle(s) must be fully stowed in both cockpits to make
sure that normal braking with anti-skid is available.
Due to friction in the EMERG BRK handle mechanism, the handle may
not return to the fully stowed position unless positively pushed.
2.8.3.5.2 EMERG BRK Handle (Rear Cockpit Lots 21 thru 25). The EMERG BRK handle, located
on the lower left main instrument panel in the rear cockpit, is used to select emergency braking from
the rear cockpit. When stowed, the handle is oriented vertically.
Stowed

The position of the EMERG BRK handle is the only indication that
emergency braking is selected: no warning or caution is displayed. The
EMERG BRK handle(s) must be fully stowed in both cockpits to make
sure that normal braking with anti-skid is available.
Due to friction in the EMERG BRK handle mechanism, the handle may
not return to the fully stowed position unless positively pushed.
2.8.3.6 Parking Brake System. The parking brake is used to lock the main landing gear wheels when
the aircraft is parked. The parking brake is activated when the PARK BRK handle is rotated and
pulled to the locked position. This action places the emergency brake valve in the parking brake mode.
Backup hydraulic pressure from HYD 2B or the brake and APU accumulators is applied to the wheel
brake hydraulic servovalves and routed to the main wheel brakes through the emergency brake lines.
The PARK BRK caution will come on to alert the pilot that the parking brake is still set when both
throttles are advanced above about 80% N2 rpm (INS on).
2.8.3.6.1 PARK BRK Handle. The PARK BRK handle is combined with the EMERG BRK handle
and is located on the lower left main instrument panel in the front cockpit. From the stowed
(horizontal) position, the handle must be rotated 90° counterclockwise and pulled to the locked
position, in order to activate the parking brake. When the handle is in the vertical position, the
‘‘PARK’’ label appears upright. See figure 2-18. If emergency brakes are selected, the handle must be
returned to the stowed position before the parking brake can be activated. Rotating the handle 45°
counterclockwise releases the lock and allows the handle to return to the stowed (horizontal) position.
Stowed

Parking brake set.
Several aircraft systems utilize parking brake activation to enable or disable logic. A set parking
brake is used to enable anti-skid BIT logic, GEN TIE logic, and INS alignment and is used to trigger
the PARK BRAKE caution.
2.8.3.7 Main Wheel Anti-Spin. The anti-spin function stops main landing gear wheel rotation prior
to landing gear retraction. When the LDG GEAR handle is moved to the UP position, main landing
gear retract pressure is supplied to the anti-skid control valve. Normal brake pressure is blocked and
this anti-spin pressure is routed to the wheel brakes through the normal brake lines. Unlock and
retraction of the main landing gear is delayed until anti-spin pressure is applied and main wheel
rotation has stopped.
2.8.4 Launch Bar System. The launch bar is electrically controlled, hydraulically extended, and
mechanically retracted. With weight on the nose gear, placing the LAUNCH BAR switch to EXTEND
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-56 ORIGINAL
energizes the launch bar control valve and routes HYD 2A pressure to unlock, lower, and hold down the
launch bar. The green L BAR advisory light indicates that the launch bar has been extended.
With the launch bar extended, returning the LAUNCH BAR switch to RETRACT deenergizes the
launch bar control valve, isolates HYD 2A pressure, and allows dual retract springs to mechanically
return the launch bar to the up and locked position. A launch bar proximity switch is energized when
the launch bar is fully retracted.
When the launch bar is fully extended it is held against the deck by HYD 2A pressure. Deck load
springs allow vertical movement of the launch bar during taxi over the catapult shuttle. When the
aircraft is placed in tension on the catapult, the launch bar is held captive in the extended position by
the shuttle. Once in tension, the LAUNCH BAR switch should be placed to RETRACT in order to
remove HYD 2A pressure from the launch bar. When the LAUNCH BAR switch is placed to
RETRACT, the green L BAR light should go out.
Failure to place the LAUNCH BAR switch to RETRACT prior to
catapult launch may result in launch bar hydraulic seal failure and
possible loss of HYD 2A.
At the end of the catapult stroke, launch bar/shuttle separation occurs and allows the retract springs
to return the launch bar to the up and locked position. When engaged, the launch bar uplock prevents
the launch bar from dropping to the deck due to g-loads during landing.
If the launch bar does not return to the up and locked position after catapult launch (launch bar
proximity switch not energized), the nose landing gear cannot be retracted. In this case, placing the
LDG GEAR handle UP will raise the main landing gear and leave the nose landing gear extended.
2.8.4.1 LAUNCH BAR Switch. The LAUNCH BAR switch, located on the lower left main instrument
panel in the front cockpit, is used to control the position of the aircraft’s launch bar. The switch is
spring loaded to the RETRACT position and is electrically held in the EXTEND position only if
weight is on the nose gear.
RETRACT Launch bar control valve deenergized. Launch bar up.
EXTEND Launch bar control valve energized. Launch bar unlocked and extended by HYD
2A pressure. Green L BAR advisory light on.
2.8.4.2 LB Circuit Breaker. The LB circuit breaker is located on the left-hand circuit breaker panel
above the left console. The LB circuit breaker provides a secondary means to raise the launch bar
following a launch bar malfunction. When pulled, the circuit breaker manually deenergizes the launch
bar control valve, removing HYD 2A pressure and allowing the retract springs to raise the launch bar.
Typically, this action would be required only if (1) the LAUNCH BAR switch failed in the EXTEND
position with weight on the nose gear or (2) the nose gear failed WonW after launch and the pilot failed
to place the LAUNCH BAR switch to RETRACT.
2.8.4.3 L BAR Warning/Advisory Lights. Two L BAR lights, one green and one red, are located on
the left warning, caution, and advisory lights panel. Both lights are controlled by the landing gear
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-57 ORIGINAL
control unit (LGCU), based on inputs from the LAUNCH BAR switch, the launch bar proximity
switch, and various landing gear proximity switches.
The green L BAR advisory light is used to indicate that the launch bar has been extended. The
LGCU illuminates the green L BAR light when all of the following conditions are met: weight on the
nose gear, the LAUNCH BAR switch in EXTEND, the launch bar not up (launch bar proximity switch
not energized), and the red L BAR warning light not on.
The red L BAR warning light is used to indicate failure of the launch bar to retract after catapult
launch or a failure in the launch bar control system (proximity switch failure). The LGCU illuminates
the red L BAR light when one of the following sets of conditions are met:
1. Launch bar not up and weight off the left main gear.
2. Launch bar not up and left main gear not down.
3. LAUNCH BAR switch in EXTEND and weight off the left main gear.
4. LAUNCH BAR switch in EXTEND and left main gear not down.
The first set of conditions is the primary L BAR warning, e.g., the launch bar does not retract fully
after catapult launch. The other three sets of conditions provide a backup L BAR warning if one or
more of the proximity switches which control launch bar functioning fail.
2.8.5 Arresting Hook System. The arresting hook is always down-loaded by a nitrogen-charged
accumulator (arresting hook snubber) contained in the arresting hook retract actuator. Arresting hook
extension is therefore accomplished by mechanically releasing the arresting hook uplatch mechanism
(HOOK handle down) and allowing snubber pressure and gravity to extend the hook. The hook should
extend in less than 2 seconds. At touchdown, the arresting hook snubber controls hook bounce and
provides a hold down force for arresting cable engagement.
Arresting hook retraction is accomplished by raising the HOOK handle. This electrically opens the
aft isolation valve and the arresting hook selector valve, routing HYD 2B pressure to the arresting hook
retract actuator. HYD 2B pressure overcomes the snubber down-load pressure and raises the hook. The
arresting hook uplatch mechanism captures and locks the hook in the up position. The hook should
retract in less than 4 seconds. If HYD 2B pressure is lost, the arresting hook cannot be retracted.
2.8.5.1 HOOK Handle. The HOOK handle, located on the lower right main instrument panel in the
front cockpit, is used to control arresting hook extension and retraction.
Up
(unmarked)
Retracts the arresting hook utilizing HYD 2B pressure.
Down
(unmarked)
Unlocks the arresting hook uplatch mechanism and allows arresting hook snubber
pressure and gravity to extend the hook.
2.8.5.2 HOOK Light. The red HOOK light is located on the lower right main instrument panel
directly above the HOOK handle. The HOOK light comes on any time hook position does not agree
with HOOK handle position. The light comes on when the hook leaves the up and locked position and
remains on until the hook is fully extended (hook proximity switch energized). With WonW, the hook
will strike the ground before it reaches full extension, so the HOOK light will remain on.
In Lot 26 AND UP, there is a green HOOK light in the rear cockpit on the left warning, caution, and
advisory panel. This HOOK light illuminates when the hook is down.

2.9 WING FOLD SYSTEM
The aircraft’s outer wing panels are designed to fold vertically to reduce the amount of deck space
occupied by the aircraft in the carrier environment. Each wing contains an independent wingfold
mechanism, which consists of two electric motors (one to lock/unlock the wings and one to spread/fold
the wings). During normal operation, the wings are spread, locked, unlocked, and folded in unison.
2.9.1 Wingfold Mechanism. Each wingfold mechanism contains a dc electric motor, which locks and
unlocks the wings, and an ac electric drive unit, which spreads and folds the wings. When the wings are
spread and locked, a locking bolt is electrically driven through the wingfold hinge, holding it in place.
When the wings are unlocked, a wing unlock flag (commonly called a beer can) protrudes from the
upper surface of the wing near the leading edge of the wingfold hinge, indicating that the locking bolt
is unstowed. The shaft of each beer can is painted red for easy identification. When the wings are
locked, the top of the beer can should be flush or near flush with the upper surface of the wing, and no
red should be showing.
Additionally, when the wings are folded, the ailerons are mechanically locked in the faired position
by a hook on the inboard aileron hinge, which engages an aileron locking pin. The aileron locking pin
is mechanically extended as the wings fold. The hook and locking pin are designed to prevent the
ailerons from blowing inboard over the TEFs when hydraulic power is not applied. If an aileron locking
pin should break, it is possible for the aileron to blow inward over the TEF. If this condition exists
during engine start, the TEF will retract into the aileron, damaging both surfaces.
If the wings are folded, note the position of the ailerons during the
preflight walk-around. If the aileron locking pins do not restrain the
ailerons in the faired position, make sure the ailerons are moved to a
faired or outboard position prior to engine start to preclude damaging the
ailerons and TEFs.
Each wingfold mechanism also contains a wing safety switch, which electrically prevents wingfold
movement. The safety switch is activated by a ″remove before flight″ pin inserted in the underside of
the wing near the wingfold hinge.
For ground crew operations (such as loading wingtip missiles), each wing can be manually unlocked,
folded, or spread. The beer cans can be manually extended by inserting a screwdriver into the wing
unlock motor (underside, leading edge). Once unlocked, the wings can be folded or spread by inserting
a speed handle into the electric drive unit (underside, trailing edge).
2.9.2 Wingfold Operation. With the wings folded, wing spread and lock is commanded by placing the
WINGFOLD switch to SPREAD. The SPREAD command is sent directly to the electric drive units to
spread the wings (there are no WonW or FCC interlocks). When each wing reaches the completely
spread position, power is removed to that electric drive unit, and that wing is automatically
commanded to lock. The WING UNLK caution will not be removed until both wings are locked (both
beer cans down). Once the wings are spread and locked, the ailerons will droop to the position
scheduled by the FCCs based on FLAP switch position.
The wings can be stopped in an intermediate position by placing the WINGFOLD switch to HOLD.
If the wings are spread, selecting HOLD unlocks the wings without folding, allowing full time NWS HI
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-59 ORIGINAL
to be engaged for operations in the carrier environment. This function is useful when NWS HI is
desired but wingfold is not, e.g., dearming wingtip missiles after carrier arrestment.
With the wings spread and locked, wingfold is commanded by placing the WINGFOLD switch to
FOLD. In order for the wings to unlock, ground power must be applied or the aircraft must be WonW
(left main). The initial FOLD command electrically unlocks the wings (beer cans extended, WING
UNLK caution displayed) and fairs the ailerons. When the FCCs determine that (1) weight is on
wheels, (2) airspeed is less than 100 KCAS accelerating or 66 KCAS decelerating, (3) the ailerons are
faired, and (4) both wings are unlocked, the FOLD command is sent to the electric drive units to fold
the wings. When each wing reaches the completely folded position, power is removed to that electric
drive unit
2.9.3 WINGFOLD Switch. The WINGFOLD switch, located on the lower right main instrument
panel, is lever-locked in all three positions. The switch has a barrier guard to prevent inadvertent
actuation.
FOLD
(& unlock)
Unlocks the wings (WING UNLK caution displayed), fairs the ailerons, and, when
allowed by the FCCs, folds the wings.
HOLD
(& unlock)
Stops wing movement in an intermediate position. If spread, unlocks the wings.
SPREAD
(& lock)
Spreads and locks the wings. (WING UNLK caution removed when both wings are
locked).
Ensure the WINGFOLD switch is lever-locked in the SPREAD position
during takeoff checks. If the wings are commanded to unlock or fold
during a catapult shot, the wings will unlock, the ailerons will fair, the
wings may fold partially, and the aircraft will settle.
2.9.4 Wingfold Overheat Cutout Protection. The wingfold electric drive units are designed to meet
the following duty cycle requirements: two (2) fold-spread cycles followed by a twelve (12) minute
cooldown period. If wingfold operation exceeds this duty cycle, overheat cutout protection may
shutdown wingfold operation to prevent actuator damage. Once overheat cutout protection has been
activated, normal wingfold operation is not restored until actuator temperature drops within limits;
however, the wings can still be unlocked, folded, or spread manually.
2.10 FCS - FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM
The flight control system (FCS) is a fly-by-wire, full authority control augmentation system (CAS).
The FCS provides four basic functions: aircraft stability, aircraft control, departure resistance, and
structural loads management. Since the basic airframe is statically neutral to slightly unstable, a
primary function of the FCS is to maintain aircraft stability at all flight conditions. The FCS also
provides full authority control of the aircraft by implementing the basic flight control laws which
determine aircraft response to pilot inputs. Pilot inputs from the stick and rudder pedals send
electrical commands to two quad-redundant, digital flight control computers (FCC A and FCC B).
There is no mechanical linkage between the stick and rudder pedals and the flight control surfaces.
FCC software determines what commands are sent to the various flight control surfaces to exercise
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-60 ORIGINAL
pitch, roll, and yaw control of the aircraft. Additionally, the FCS provides departure resistance by
either refusing to accept or by tailoring pilot inputs that would otherwise lead to an aircraft departure.
Lastly, the FCS provides structural loads management by limiting g-available to prevent an aircraft
overstress or by retracting flight control surfaces at airspeeds that would otherwise exceed the
structural limits of the airframe. See figure 2-19 for a functional diagram of the flight control system.
2.10.1 Flight Control Surfaces. The aircraft has 12 primary flight control surfaces including leading
edge flaps (LEFs), trailing edge flaps (TEFs), ailerons, twin rudders, horizontal stabilators, and
spoilers. LEFs, TEFs, ailerons, and stabilators can be moved both symmetrically or differentially for
pitch and roll control. Flight control surface deflection limits are shown in figure 2-20.
Pitch control is accomplished with symmetric stabilators and, in some conditions, with rudder toe-in
or rudder flare. Roll control is accomplished with combinations of ailerons, differential stabilators,
differential LEFs, and differential TEFs dependent on flight condition and CAS operating mode. The
twin rudders deflect symmetrically for directional control. There is no dedicated speedbrake surface.
Instead, a ″speedbrake function″ is provided by partial deflection of several of the primary flight
control surfaces.
Hydraulic power to all flight control surface actuators is supplied by HYD 1 and HYD 2. Stabilator
and TEF actuators are powered simultaneously by one HYD circuit from each system. All other
actuators are powered by a single primary HYD circuit, with backup hydraulic power available through
a hydro-mechanical switching valve. See the Hydraulic System section, specifically the Hydraulic Flow
Diagram, to determine which HYD circuits power each flight control surface actuator.
Surface Deflection limits *
Aileron 25° TEU to 42° TED
Rudder 40° left or right
Stabilator 24° TEU to 20° TED
LEF 5° LEU to 34° LED
TEF 8° TEU to 40° TED
LEX Spoilers 0° or 60° TEU
* Tolerance ±1°, or ±3° for spoilers.
Figure 2-19. FCS Surface Deflections
2.10.1.1 Spoilers. The spoilers are mounted on top of the fuselage near the aft end of the LEX. The
spoilers are controlled by the FCCs and have two fixed positions: 0° (down) or 60° TEU. The 60° TEU
position is activated by the speedbrake function or when more than 15° TED stabilator is commanded
(forward stick) above 22° AOA to aid in recovery from high AOA.
2.10.2 FCCs - Flight Control Computers. Two flight control computers (FCC A and FCC B) provide
the computations which implement the aircraft’s flight control laws. A four-channel architecture is
used to provide FCS redundancy. Each FCC contains two individual central processing units (CPUs),
which each run one channel of the FCS. CH 1 and CH 2 are resident in FCC A, with CH 3 and CH 4
in FCC B.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-61 ORIGINAL
Figure 2-20. Flight Control System Functional Diagram
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-62 ORIGINAL
Most inputs to the FCCs (rate gyros, accelerometers, air data sensors, stick and rudder pedal
position sensors) are quad-redundant, one input for each channel. Each of the four CPUs runs
independent and parallel flight control computations. Sensor inputs as well as CPU outputs are
continuously monitored by the FCCs for agreement. When there is disagreement, the erroneous signal
is discarded, if possible.
Rate and acceleration data are provided by two independent Attitude and Heading Reference Sets
(AHRS), one for each FCC. Each AHRS has two sets of ring laser rate gyros and two sets of
accelerometers, which provide four independent sources of pitch, roll, and yaw rate information, and
four independent sources of normal and lateral acceleration. The AHRS units have the capability to
provide attitude, heading, and longitudinal acceleration data, but it is not currently utilized. The
physical rate and acceleration sensors in each AHRS channel are not aligned with the aircraft’s pitch,
roll, and yaw axis. This raw sensor data is converted to the aircraft’s pitch, roll, and yaw axis by
microprocessors internal to each AHRS. As a result of this architecture, a single rate gyro failure in one
channel results in all three axis rates being unusable in that same channel (CAS P, R, Y in one channel
Xd out). Similarly, if any of the accelerometers fail, all acceleration data from that AHRS channel is
unusable (N ACC and L ACC in one channel will both be Xd out).
FCC channel outputs are transmitted to the appropriate flight control actuators and to other aircraft
systems such as the MCs. While FCC computations run in all four channels, all flight control actuators
are not commanded in all four channels. The stabilators and TEF actuators do receive command
signals from all four FCC channels. However, each aileron, rudder, spoiler, and LEF actuator only
receives command signals from two FCC channels, one from FCC A and one from FCC B. The
2-channel actuators on the left side of the aircraft receive inputs from CH 1 and CH 4 while the
2-channel actuators on the right side receive inputs from CH 2 and CH 3. This channel distribution can
be seen on the FCS format.
2.10.2.1 FCC Temperature Monitoring. FCC A contains a thermocouple which monitors the
temperature within the computer and provides a signal to FCC CH 1 and CH 2. If an over-temperature
condition is detected, the FCS HOT caution and caution light come on, and the ″Flight computer hot,
Flight computer hot″ voice alert annunciates. Additionally, FCC A indicates OVRHT on the BIT
status line. In this case, placing the AV COOL switch to EMERG provides emergency ram air cooling
to FCC A and the right TR via a dedicated FCS ram air scoop. FCC B also contains a thermocouple,
but does not set the FCS HOT cautions. The only indication of an over-temperature condition in FCC
B is a BIT status indication of OVRHT.
2.10.2.2 AV COOL Switch. The AV COOL switch is located on the lower right main instrument panel
outboard of the caution light panel.
NORM FCS ram air scoop retracted.
EMERG Deploys the FCS ram air scoop for emergency ram air cooling of FCC A, the right
TR, and other essential avionics.
Once deployed, the FCS ram air scoop cannot be retracted inflight.
2.10.3 FCS Redundancy and Survivability. Hydraulic redundancy is provided by distributing flight
control actuators among the four HYD circuits. This arrangement minimizes the probability of losing
multiple actuators due to catastrophic damage to any single actuator or its hydraulic lines. Following
a single HYD system failure, the other HYD system is capable of powering the entire FCS. Loss of
HYD 1 or HYD 2 in up and away flight does not affect aircraft control. However, in the takeoff and
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-63 ORIGINAL
landing configuration, small but controllable roll and/or yaw excursions may be expected as hydraulic
switching valves cycle to their backup circuits.
The primary electrical power source for each FCC channel is a dedicated output from one of two
permanent magnet generators (PMGs). See the Electrical System section for FCC Electrical Redundancy. Should a power interruption occur to any single FCC channel, the FCC power supply
automatically switches to a ″keep alive″ circuit connected directly to the maintenance bus for 7 to 10
seconds. This makes sure that the FCCs have uninterrupted power to maintain full operation during
all predictable electrical bus switching transients.
For survivability, wiring for one channel from each computer is routed through the upper part of the
aircraft with wiring for the other through the lower part of the aircraft. This routing minimizes the
possibility of loss of any one flight control surface due to system failures or battle damage. If a
stabilator actuator fails due to multiple FCS or hydraulic failures, the FCS automatically reconfigures
to maintain 3-axis control and acceptable handling qualities by using the remaining surfaces. There is
no mechanical FCS reversion mode.
2.10.4 CAS Operating Modes. The control augmentation system (CAS) operates in two basic modes:
Powered Approach (PA) and Up-AUTO (UA). Mode selection is controlled by FLAP switch position
and airspeed. With the FLAP switch in HALF or FULL and with airspeed below approximately 240
KCAS, CAS implements flight control laws tailored for the takeoff and landing configuration (PA).
With the FLAP switch in AUTO, CAS implements flight control laws tailored for up and away flight
(UA). If the FLAP switch is left in HALF or FULL, the aircraft automatically transitions from PA to
UA when airspeed increases above approximately 240 KCAS. This is known as ″auto flap retract.″ In
this case, the amber FLAPS light comes on to alert the pilot to check FLAP switch position. The flight
control laws utilized in each mode are tailored to provide maximum maneuverability while maintaining
predictable handling qualities and departure resistance.
2.10.4.1 FLAP Switch. The FLAP switch, located on the lower left main instrument panel, is used to
select the CAS operating mode and to position the TEFs and aileron droop for takeoff and landing.
AUTO Selects UA operating mode for up and away flight.
HALF Selects PA operating mode for the takeoff and landing configuration. Sets TEF
deflection and aileron droop to 30° TED (WonW or at approach speed).
FULL Selects PA operating mode for the takeoff and landing configuration. Sets TEF
deflection and aileron droop to 40° TED (WonW or at approach speed).
2.10.4.2 Flap Position Lights. Three flap position lights, two green and one amber, are located on the
lower left main instrument panel. The green HALF and FULL flap lights are used to indicate FLAP
switch position and are not indications of actual TEF/aileron position. The FCS format should be
referenced to determine actual LEF, TEF, and aileron position.
FLAPS

2.10.5.1 Pitch CAS. Pitch CAS (P CAS) utilizes normal acceleration, pitch rate, and AOA feedback,
each scheduled based on aircraft flight conditions, to tailor aircraft response to pilot stick inputs and
to provide stabilator actuator commands. P CAS operates by comparing aircraft response to the pilot’s
longitudinal stick input, driving the stabilator actuators symmetrically until the difference is reduced
to zero.
In UA, with neutral longitudinal stick, comparing pilot input to aircraft response has the effect of
constantly trimming the aircraft to steady-state, hands-off 1g flight, essentially removing the
requirement for manual trim. In maneuvering flight, P CAS modifies aircraft response to stick inputs
creating the effect of changing stick forces to provide pilot cueing. Actual stick forces for a given stick
displacement do not change with flight condition. At high airspeeds, P CAS is a g-command system
requiring 3.5 pounds of stick-force-per-g. At medium airspeeds, P CAS acts as a hybrid pitch rate and
g-command system. Pitch rate feedback is used to increase apparent stick-force-per-g (heavier stick
forces) to cue the pilot that airspeed is decreasing and less g is available. At low airspeed, P CAS is
primarily an AOA command system using AOA feedback above 22° AOA to provide increasing stick
forces with increasing AOA. With large forward stick inputs, P CAS augments nose-down pitch rates
by flaring the rudders and raising the spoilers.
In PA, AOA and pitch rate feedbacks are used to augment inherent airframe pitch damping and
stability. P CAS nulls the difference between the commanded AOA and actual AOA. With neutral
longitudinal stick, P CAS maintains trim AOA. Unlike UA, pitch trim is required in PA to trim the
aircraft on-speed. Rudder toe-in is used to improve longitudinal stability and to aid aircraft rotation
during takeoff or bolter. Rudder toe-in is a function of AOA. At 0° AOA or with WonW, the rudders
are toed-in 40°. Rudder toe-in decreases linearly to 0° of toe at 12° AOA. Additional AOA feedback is
provided above 12° AOA which increases stick forces with increasing AOA to provide stall warning.
Pitch rate feedback helps maintain tight pitch attitude control during turns.
2.10.5.2 Roll CAS. Roll CAS (R CAS) schedules aileron, differential LEF, differential TEF, and
differential stabilator commands in response to lateral stick inputs to achieve the desired roll
characteristics. Roll rate feedback, scheduled based on aircraft flight conditions, is used to augment
inherent airframe roll damping. Differential LEFs and TEFs are only used in UA. The LEFs deflect
differentially up to 5° when below 25,000 feet and above Mach 0.6. Differential TEFs are not used
above 10° AOA or below -5° AOA. At high airspeeds, aileron, differential stabilator and differential
TEF travel are reduced to provide consistent roll rate response and to aid in preventing structural
loads exceedances. At low airspeeds, aileron and differential stabilator travel are reduced with
increasing AOA to minimize adverse yaw. Differential stabilator may also be limited due to pitch
commands which have priority over lateral commands.
With clean wing or A/A missile loadings (no wing tanks), maximum roll rate is limited to
approximately 225°/second. With A/G store or external fuel tank codes set in the armament computer
for any wing station and the pylon rack hooks closed for those stations, maximum roll rate is limited
to approximately 150°/second to avoid exceeding pylon structural load limits. If all stores are shown as
HUNG, roll rate limiting is removed; however, an R-LIM OFF caution appears on the DDI.
R CAS incorporates two features to reduce pitch-roll inertial coupling induced departures. Based on
pitch rate and Mach number, the first feature reduces the roll command when the pilot applies an
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-65 ORIGINAL
excessive combined lateral/longitudinal stick input. The second feature limits the roll command when
the aircraft is already rolling and longitudinal stick is moved rapidly. This second feature is removed
at low altitude and high speed since available pitch rate does not result in significant pitch-roll inertial
coupling.
2.10.5.3 Yaw CAS. Yaw CAS (Y CAS) uses yaw rate and lateral acceleration feedback to provide
directional axis damping and to augment pilot commands to the twin rudder actuators. A rollingsurface-to-rudder interconnect (RSRI) adjusted by roll-rate-to-rudder crossfeed (scheduled with
AOA), and lateral acceleration feedback are used to minimize sideslip for roll coordination. To provide
departure resistance and enhanced maneuverability at high AOA, directional stability is augmented
utilizing INS pitch and roll attitudes along with the FCS sensors to synthesize sideslip and sideslip rate
feedback to the ailerons and differential stabilators. These lateral surfaces are used in this sense as
directional controllers by taking advantage of the strong yawing moments they produce at high AOA.
Below 13° AOA, rudder pedal deflections provide yaw by symmetric rudder deflection. At 25° AOA
and above, rudder pedal deflections no longer provide yaw control inputs but instead act entirely as a
roll controller (identical to lateral stick input) by commanding aileron and differential stabilator with
the RSRI commanding the required rudder deflection for roll coordination. Rudder pedal inputs are
summed with lateral stick inputs and this combined input is limited to a value equal to a maximum
lateral stick input. Therefore, applying pedal opposite to lateral stick cancels lateral stick inputs
proportional to the pedal input, e.g., full opposite pedal cancels a full lateral stick command resulting
in zero roll rate. Between 13° and 25° AOA, rudder pedal deflection gradually changes from pure yaw
control to pure roll control. This method of control provides enhanced departure resistance at high
AOA.
Some traditional directional control capability is returned at low airspeed and high AOA only when
the pilot applies lateral stick and rudder in the same direction. This feature starts becoming effective
only at airspeeds below approximately 225 KCAS, from 20° to 40° AOA, but is most effective at
approximately 170 KCAS and 34° AOA. Enabling this feature outside of these conditions would
compromise departure resistance. When this feature is enabled, the sum of lateral stick and rudder
pedal command is no longer limited to a value equal to a full lateral stick input. The excess roll
command is fed to the directional axis to command sideslip. For example, adding full rudder pedal with
a full lateral stick input provides a maximum roll and yaw command. Alternatively, adding lateral stick
to an existing full rudder pedal input has the same effect. The resulting aircraft motion is a highly
controllable nose-high to nose-low reversal.
At high airspeeds, symmetric rudder deflection is reduced and the rudders are toed in to avoid
exceeding vertical tail structural limits.
In PA mode, synthesized sideslip rate feedback augments aerodynamic directional damping and
stability.
2.10.5.4 Flap Scheduling. In UA, LEFs, TEFs, and aileron droop are scheduled as a function of AOA
and air data to optimize cruise and turn performance, to improve high AOA characteristics, and to
provide load alleviation (when required). In general, LEFs start to deflect as AOA increases above
approximately 3°, reaching full deflection (34° LED) by about 25° AOA. In general, TEFs start to
deflect above 2 to 3° AOA, are at full scheduled deflection (approximately 10 to 12° TED) from
approximately 6 to 15° AOA, and begin to retract as AOA increases further. In other words, TEFs are
deflected in the heart of the maneuvering envelope to produce more lift and are retracted at high AOA.
In UA, aileron droop is scheduled to 50% of TEF deflection at low AOA and to 0° at high AOA.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-66 ORIGINAL
In UA, flap scheduling is altered slightly based on the presence of wing tanks. With wing tanks
installed, TEF deflection is slightly lower at most flight conditions. LEFs and TEFs typically begin to
deflect at slightly slower Mach but follow the same trends as those mentioned above.
In PA, LEFs are scheduled as a function of AOA to maximize lift. TEFs are scheduled as a function
of airspeed for load alleviation but should be at maximum scheduled deflection at approach speed. In
PA, aileron droop is scheduled with TEF deflection. Following field takeoff or catapult launch,
TEF/aileron droop is latched for 10 seconds after the transition to WoffW. This feature is designed to
improve catapult launch characteristics by ensuring the flaps do not retract immediately after launch.
However, if approximately 190 KCAS is exceeded prior to expiration of the 10 second timer, the TEFs
and aileron droop do begin to retract for loads alleviation. LEF, TEF, and aileron droop scheduling are
shown in figure 2-21.

2.10.6 Speedbrake Function. The aircraft is not fitted with independent speedbrake surfaces. A
″speedbrake function″ is provided to increase drag by partial deflection of several of the aircraft’s
primary flight control surfaces: ailerons, rudders, TEFs, and spoilers. The stabilators are commanded
to counter pitch transients during speedbrake extension and retraction. The full speedbrake function
can only be commanded in UA.
At subsonic speeds in UA, the speedbrake function flares the rudders and symmetrically raises the
ailerons TEU to approximately 95% of the capability of each surface at the given flight conditions.
This makes sure approximately 5% of surface authority is available for yaw and roll control. If needed,
rudder and aileron priority is given to yaw and roll commands. TEFs are also symmetrically lowered
to further increase drag and to counter the loss of lift caused by deflecting the ailerons TEU. The
spoilers are raised to the full up 60° position only when the speedbrake command reaches 75%. At
subsonic speeds, the stabilator is used to offset any pitch transients that occur due to the deflection of
all speedbrake surfaces except the spoiler. Delaying spoiler deflection until 75% allows the pilot to use
partial speedbrakes for speed modulation, while avoiding minor spoiler induced pitch transients.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-67 ORIGINAL
At supersonic speeds in UA, speedbrake surface deflections are changed. The rudders are not
deflected above 1.05 M due to vertical tail loads. The ailerons and TEFs are not deflected above 1.1 M
due to a lack of effectiveness. The spoilers are therefore deflected immediately upon speedbrake
actuation, since they are the only effective surface at these conditions. At supersonic speeds, the
stabilator is used to counter spoiler deployment. The speedbrake function is completely disabled above
1.5 IMN.
In UA, the speedbrake function is ramped out above 16° AOA or below -9° AOA to preserve
lateral-directional stability and between -3.0 to -1.5g for airframe loads.
In PA, the speedbrake function is disabled with WoffW. With WonW and the FLAP switch in HALF
or FULL, the speedbrake function only deploys the spoilers. While the spoilers can be deployed during
landing rollout or aborted takeoff, the drag increase is minimal, and rollout distance is not appreciably
decreased. With WonW and the FLAP switch in AUTO, full extension of the speedbrake function
commands 20° of rudder flare, 23° of TEU aileron, 7° of TED TEF, 60° of spoiler, and a 2° TED
stabilator change.
2.10.6.1 Speedbrake Switch. The speedbrake switch, located on the inboard side of the right throttle
grip, is used to enable/disable the speedbrake function, e.g., extend/retract the speedbrake surfaces.
The forward and center positions are detented, while the aft position is spring-loaded back to center
and must be held. In the F/A-18F (trainer configuration), the rear cockpit speedbrake switch has
override priority over the front cockpit switch.
Forward
(unmarked)
Retracts speedbrake surfaces (full retraction in 2 seconds).
Center
(unmarked)
Stops speedbrake surfaces at an intermediate position.
Aft
(unmarked)
Extends speedbrake surfaces (full extension in 2 seconds).
NOTE
• If the speedbrake switch is held or fails in the aft position for more
than 5 minutes, the speedbrake switch is declared failed, and the FCS
caution is set. If the switch is failed or is held in the aft position when
the FCS RESET button is pushed, the speedbrake surfaces are
retracted, Xs are set on the DEGD row of the FCS page, and the
speedbrake function is disabled for the remainder of the flight.
• If the front cockpit switch is held in the aft position during any FCS
RESET attempt, the speedbrake switch is declared failed; the speedbrake surfaces are retracted; and the speedbrake function is disabled
for the remainder of the flight. This allows the speedbrake surfaces to
be retracted before the 5 minute timer expires, if the front cockpit
switch is stuck in the aft position.
• In the F/A-18F (trainer configuration), if the rear cockpit switch fails
in the aft position, the 5 minute timer must expire before the
speedbrake surfaces can be retracted with the FCS RESET button.

advisory panel on the main instrument panel. The SPD BRK light comes on anytime the speedbrake
surfaces are not fully retracted.
2.10.7 G-Limiter Considerations. In order to understand what protection the aircraft’s g-limiter
provides, pilots must understand the difference between ″design limit-g″ and ″reference load factor (Nz
REF).″ See the Acceleration Limitations chart in the Operating Limitations chapter for a plot of Nz
REF versus gross weight, for g-limiter specifics, and for gross weight related g-restrictions.
2.10.7.1 Design Limit-g. The aircraft was designed to sustain a limit-g of +7.5g or -3.0g (symmetric)
only at or below its fighter design gross weight of 42,097 lb. At higher gross weights, design limit-g is
reduced to keep from exceeding the structural limitations of the airframe. An ″overstress″ is defined as
a g-level that exceeds the design limit-g at the aircraft’s current gross weight. Above 42,097 lb gross
weight, design limit-g is reduced by the aircraft’s relative gross weight (42,097/GW), such that the
positive design limit is +7.5g * (42,097/GW) and the negative design limit is -0.4 * (positive limit-g). At
the aircraft’s maximum gross weight (66,000 lb), design limit-g is only +4.8g or -1.9g.
Due to the increased airframe and pylon loads that accompany high-g rolling maneuvers, the aircraft
also has a design limit-g for abrupt full-stick rolls (FSR). Abrupt FSRs are defined as full lateral stick
in less than 1 second. The positive design FSR limit is +6.0g below 42,097 lb GW and 80% of the
symmetric design limit-g above 42,097 lb. The negative design FSR limit is -1.0g at all gross weights.
At 66,000 lb GW, the positive design FSR limit is only +3.8g.
2.10.7.2 Reference Load Factor (Nz REF). Reference load factor (Nz REF) is the value that the MC
uses to set the g-limiter when outside of the transonic g-bucket (described below). With increasing
gross weight, Nz REF is the same as design limit-g until the gross weight where +5.5g (-2.2g) is
available (57,405 lb GW). Above 57,405 lb GW, Nz REF is held fixed at +5.5g (-2.2g) in order to assure
that the pilot always has those g-levels available even if they would result in an overstress. Since the
g-limiter may not prevent an overstress at gross weights above 57,405 lb, the pilot must be responsible
for preventing an overstress in this gross weight region.
2.10.7.3 G-Limiter. The g-limiter essentially limits the amount of positive and negative g that can be
commanded by the pilot at a particular gross weight in order to prevent an aircraft overstress. Once the
pilot reaches the stick displacement required to attain the Nz REF g-limit, further stick inputs do not
increase g. This is commonly called ″being on the limiter.″ Once the stick is relaxed to the limit
displacement, g-control below Nz REF is regained. The g-limiter functions to maintain both the
positive and negative Nz REF limits.
During abrupt longitudinal stick inputs, g-limiter overshoots are not uncommon. G-limiter overshoots of up to +0.5g or -0.2g are allowed and do not constitute an over-g. An ″over-g″ is defined as a
g-level which exceeds the overshoot thresholds and sets MSP code 811 (positive exceedance) or 925
(negative exceedance). An over-g condition requires a postflight inspection to determine if an
″overstress″ occurred.
For rolling maneuvers commenced above the positive FSR limit, the g-limiter also provides some
protection. In this region, the g-limiter attempts to reduce commanded-g towards the positive FSR
limit to prevent an overstress. However, if the rate of lateral stick input exceeds the capability of the
g-limiter, an actual rolling overstress may result without setting an 811 MSP code (set only if the
symmetric over-g threshold is exceeded). The g-limiter treats rolling maneuvers with less than ¾ inch
lateral stick as symmetric maneuvers.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000

A G-LIM 7.5G caution, accompanied by the FLIGHT CONTROLS, FLIGHT CONTROLS voice
alert, is set for any of the following: FUEL XFER, CAUT DEGD, MC2, SMS failure, or an invalid fuel
quantity. A G-LIM 7.5G caution indicates that the positive symmetrical command limit has been set
to +7.5g regardless of gross weight or stores loading. If the G-LIM 7.5G caution is set, the pilot must
limit commanded g-level to prevent an overstress.
Very high g-onset rates are possible with rapid aft stick movement, with
or without g-limiter override. A very high g-onset rate can cause immediate loss of consciousness (G-LOC) without the usual warning symptoms
of tunnel vision, greyout, and blackout. The effects of G-LOC may last 20
seconds or longer after the g level is reduced to near 1.0g.
2.10.7.4 G-Bucket. Due to the aerodynamic phenomenon known as transonic pitch-up, the g-limiter
incorporates a g-bucket designed to prevent an aircraft positive over-g during transonic deceleration.
In the g-bucket, the g-limiter reduces the positive command g-limit below Nz REF (figure 2-22). This
reduction is a maximum of 1.0g above 20,000 feet, and 1.7g below 15,000 feet. For example, if Nz REF
is +7.5g and altitude is ≤15,000 feet, the g-limiter only allows +5.8g to be commanded while in the
g-bucket. The symmetrical command limit is never reduced below +4.5g.
NOTE
• G-bucket reduction reduces maximum commandable-g.
• Magnitude of transonic pitch-up increases as rate of Mach change
increases. High drag loadings with idle power settings generally have
the largest transonic pitch-ups. High drag loadings (e.g., A/G stores)
have a g-bucket that extends into a lower Mach range.
• Largest measured transonic pitch-up was 2.2g for <15,000 feet. This
magnitude pitch-up was seen on both A/A and A/G loadings.
The 0.2g deep mini-g-bucket extension in the Mach 0.85 to Mach 0.94 range was added in the FCC
OFP to protect against over-g in that region.
The Mach range for the deeper part of the g-bucket is dependent on external stores configuration.
The deeper part of the g-bucket is entered at Mach 0.905 accelerating (with at least one wing tank or
A/G wing store) or at Mach 0.941 accelerating with no wing tanks or A/G stores. Regardless of stores
loading, when decelerating, the g-bucket is entered at Mach 1.045 and is exited at Mach 0.83.
Full stick roll (FSR) limits are reduced in the g-bucket to 80% of (Nz REF minus no more than a
1.0g reduction). For example, if Nz REF is +7.5g, Mach is 0.95, and altitude is ≤15,000 feet, the
g-limiter sets the FSR limit to 80% of (Nz REF minus 1.0) even though the bucket depth is 1.7g.
If the pilot wants to have maximum-g available during a turning maneuver (e.g., the merge), or avoid
the deeper part of the g-bucket, IMN should be 0.90 or less (with at least one wing tank or A/G store),
or 0.93 or less (clean or with A/A stores). Note that even though the 0.2g mini-g-bucket might be active,
flight testing has shown the g-level will be at or slightly above Nz REF.

2.10.7.5 G-Limiter Override. A g-limiter override feature can be enabled to allow a 33% increase in
the command g-limit for emergency use (allows a 10g command at 7.5g Nz REF). G-limiter override is
selected by momentarily pressing the paddle switch when the stick is near the full aft limit. When
g-limiter override is selected, a G-LIM OVRD caution is set along with a 927 MSP code. Override is not
disengaged until the stick is returned to near the neutral position.
2.10.7.6 Roll Rate Limiting. Roll rate limiting is enabled in R CAS when external wing tanks or A/G
stores are mounted on wing pylons (hooks closed). If any A/G store indicates HUNG, a R-LIM OFF
caution is set and roll rate limiting is removed. In this case, higher than normal roll rates are possible
and may exceed the structural limitations of the airframe/pylons if pilot-imposed lateral stick limits
are not applied.
2.10.8 Air Data Function. The air data function is provided by the FCCs and not a separate
computer. The FCCs receive input from pitot-static sensors, total temperature sensors, the angle of
attack probes, the standby altimeter barometric setting, and the mission computers. The FCC air data
function applies appropriate source error corrections to the air data sensor inputs and calculates
accurate true altitude, airspeed, Mach number, AOA, and outside air temperature (OAT). Computed
air data is used internally by the FCC control augmentation system (CAS) and is also supplied to the
MCs for IFF altitude reporting, weapon system calculations, and landing gear wheels warning, to the
FADECs for engine control, and to the ECS controller for ECS scheduling and fuel tank pressurization
and vent.
2.10.8.1 Pitot-Static/Total Temperature Probes. Two combined pitot-static/total temperature
probes are mounted on the left and right forward fuselage. Each probe contains one pitot pressure
source, two static pressure sources, and a total temperature sensor. One of the static pressure sources
from each probe is connected together and pneumatically averaged. This average static source is
provided to the left and right pressure transmitter sets along with the corresponding pitot pressure
source. The left pressure transmitter set provides pitot-static input to FCC CH 1 and 4 with the right
providing input to FCC CH 2 and 3. The FCC air data function corrects sensed pitot and static
pressures for position error to provide accurate true air data for FCC calculations, MC calculations, and
display in the HUD. The pitot pressure source and the second static pressure source from the left probe
are used to drive the standby flight instruments (altitude, airspeed, and VSI). The second static
pressure source from the right probe is unused.
Each pitot-static probe also contains an integral total temperature sensor. Each total temperature
sensor converts sensed temperature to an electrical signal. The output of the left total temperature
sensor is sent to FCC CH 2, with the right to FCC CH 4. The FCCs use total temperature to calculate
OAT. Each pitot-static/total temperature probe is electrically heated to prevent icing.
2.10.8.2 AOA Probes. Two AOA probes are mounted on the left and right forward fuselage. Each
probe mechanically measures local AOA by aligning with the airstream. An integral AOA transmitter
set converts the mechanical input to a two-channel electrical signal which is sent to the FCCs. The left
AOA transmitter set provides input to FCC CH 1 and 4 with the right to FCC CH 2 and 3. The FCC
air data function corrects the sensed local AOA to a true AOA and provides the output to the MC for
display on the HUD. FCS CH 4 supplies the AOA signal which drives the AOA indexer lights and the
approach lights.
It is possible to damage and jam an AOA probe such that it continues to send signals to the FCCs.
FCC software is designed to minimize flying qualities degradation in the event of a stuck/jammed AOA
probe. The FCCs incorporate an AOA estimator which is used to identify the good AOA probe if one
is damaged. If an AOA probe split is transient, the estimator is used to identify the good probe and no
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-72 ORIGINAL
cautions are set. If the AOA probe split persists, an FCS caution is set, AOA is Xd in all four channels,
and the estimator is used for FCC calculations. See the HUD Symbology Degrades with Air Data
Function Failure paragraph and Part V for more details on AOA failures. Each AOA probe and AOA
probe cover are electrically heated to prevent icing.
2.10.8.3 PITOT ANTI ICE Switch. The PITOT ANTI ICE switch is located on the ECS panel on the
right console. This switch is used to power the electric heaters for the pitot-static/total temperature
probes, the AOA probes, and the AOA probe covers. All heaters are thermostatically controlled to
prevent damage to their corresponding sensors. With WonW, the thermostat set points are reduced to
prevent damage when cooling airflow is not provided.
ON Pitot and AOA heaters on manually (WonW or WoffW).
AUTO Pitot and AOA heaters on automatically with WoffW. Heaters off with WonW.
Failure of both AOA probe heaters in icing conditions may cause a sharp
uncommanded nose down attitude, uncontrollable by normal stick forces
or paddle switch actuation.
2.10.9 Flight Controls.
2.10.9.1 Stick. A traditional center mounted control stick is used to provide pitch and roll inputs to
the FCS. Since there is no mechanical linkage between the stick and the FCCs or the flight control
surfaces, stick feel is provided by two feel-spring assemblies and two eddy current dampers. The feel
spring assemblies provide a linear stick force versus stick displacement gradient in each axis. Two
4-channel position sensors, one in each axis, measure stick displacement and send longitudinal and
lateral stick commands to the FCCs proportional to stick displacement. Stick force and displacement
are listed in figure 2-23 for full stick travel. The eddy current dampers provide stick motion damping
in each axis. Additionally, the control stick is mass balanced to minimize longitudinal stick movement
resulting from accelerations normally experienced during catapult launch.
In the F/A-18F (trainer configuration), a control stick is also fitted in the rear cockpit and is
mechanically linked to the one in the front cockpit.

2.10.9.2 Rudder Pedals. Two rudder pedals (left and right) are used to provide directional inputs to
the FCS for yaw/roll control inflight or NWS control with WonW. Since there is no mechanical linkage
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-73 ORIGINAL
between the rudder pedals and the FCCs or the flight control surfaces, rudder pedal feel is provided
by two feel-spring assemblies. The feel spring assemblies provide a linear pedal force versus
displacement gradient. Two 4-channel position sensors, one on each pedal, measure pedal displacement and send directional commands to the FCCs proportional to pedal displacement. Rudder force
and displacement are listed in figure 2-23 for full pedal travel. The rudder pedals are also used to
provide NWS commands and to actuate toe-operated wheel brakes.
In the F/A-18F (trainer configuration), two rudder pedals are also fitted in the rear cockpit but are
not mechanically linked to the rudder pedals in the front cockpit. Pedal inputs from either cockpit are
summed together and transmitted to the FCCs. A half pedal input from the front cockpit and a half
pedal input from the rear cockpit results in a full rudder pedal command to the FCCs. Similarly,
opposing rudder pedal inputs in each cockpit cancel each other.
2.10.9.2.1 RUD PED ADJ Lever. A RUD PED ADJ lever, located on the center pedestal in each
cockpit, is spring loaded to the up and locked position. When the lever is held down, the rudder pedals
are unlocked and can be moved forward and aft in ½ inch increments. Both pedals are spring loaded
to move aft and must be pushed forward to the desired position. Releasing the RUD PED ADJ lever
locks the pedals in the new position.
• Restrain the rudder pedals during adjustment. Unrestrained rudder
pedals may damage the rudder pedal mechanism.
• Ensure the rudder pedals are locked in position after adjustment.
Failure to lock the rudder pedals may result in uncommanded forward
rudder pedal movement inflight.
2.10.9.3 Stick Grip FCS Controls. The FCS controls located on the stick grip include the pitch and
roll trim switch, the NWS button, and the autopilot/NWS disengage switch. See figure 2-24. In the
F/A-18F (trainer configuration), the FCS controls on the rear cockpit stick grip are identical to those
in the front cockpit.
2.10.9.3.1 Pitch and Roll Trim Switch. The pitch and roll trim switch is located on the top right of
the stick grip. Movement of the pitch and roll trim switch electrically biases the FCCs and does not
reposition the stick.
Forward Trims nose-down.
Aft Trims nose-up.
Left Trims left-wing-down.
Right Trims right-wing-down.
Pitch and roll trim inputs can be made incrementally or held for faster trim rates. In UA, little if any
pitch trim is required due to the automatic trimming function provided by P CAS. In PA, pitch trim
is required to trim for on-speed AOA. Lateral trim is typically only required immediately after takeoff
or following changes in lateral weight asymmetry (fuel and/or stores). Pitch trim is not monitored for
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-74 ORIGINAL
runaway trim. However, roll trim is monitored for a stuck switch. If the trim switch is held or is stuck
in the left or right position for more than 40 seconds, the FCS caution is set and the roll trim function
of the switch is disabled for the remainder of the flight. Roll trim can be faded to zero by pushing and
holding the FCS RESET button or TO/TRIM button for approximately 4 seconds.
2.10.9.3.2 NWS Button. The undesignate/nosewheel steering button is located on the front of the
stick grip. The NWS button is used to engage NWS modes, as described in the NWS System
paragraphs in the Utility Hydraulic Functions section. The undesignate function of the NWS button
is described in the Weapon Systems Controls section.
2.10.9.3.3 Paddle Switch. The autopilot/NWS disengage switch, commonly called the ″paddle
switch,″ is located on the lower front of the stick grip. The paddle switch is used to disengage NWS with
WonW, to disengage all autopilot modes with WoffW, and to enable g-limiter override with WoffW. To
enable g-limiter override, the paddle switch must be momentarily pressed with the stick near the aft
limit.
2.10.9.4 RUD TRIM Knob. The RUD TRIM knob is located on the FCS panel on the left console in
the front cockpit only. Movement of the RUD TRIM knob electrically biases the FCCs and does not
reposition the rudder pedals. Rudder trim authority is ±10° and ±22.5° of rudder surface deflection in
UA and PA, respectively. PA rudder trim authority is set to allow zero pedal forces during a HALF flap,
single engine approach. Yaw trim is zeroed by mechanically centering the RUD TRIM knob when the
T/O TRIM button is pushed with either WonW or WoffW.
Figure 2-24. Stick Grip FCS Controls
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-75 ORIGINAL
2.10.9.5 T/O TRIM Button. The T/O trim button is located in the center of the RUD TRIM knob on
the FCS panel on the left console. With WonW, holding the T/O TRIM button pressed drives pitch
trim to 4° TEU stabilator, roll trim to neutral, and yaw trim to neutral by mechanically centering the
RUD TRIM knob. Depending on initial trim position the T/O TRIM button may need to be pressed
for up to 4 seconds. When these takeoff trim settings are reached, the TRIM advisory is displayed on
the LDDI for as long as the T/O TRIM button is held depressed. With WoffW, pressing the T/O TRIM
button for as long as 4 seconds drives roll trim to neutral, centers the RUD TRIM knob, but does not
affect pitch trim.
2.10.10 Yaw Rate Warning Tone. In UA (flaps AUTO), a yaw rate warning tone is provided to alert
the pilot of excessive yaw rate that may lead to an aircraft departure. The yaw rate warning tone is
generated by the FCCs and is initiated at 40°/second yaw rate with a 1 Hz pulse rate. The tone pulse
rate increases linearly as yaw rate approaches 60°/second, where the pulse rate remains constant at 10
Hz. There is no yaw rate warning tone in PA.
2.10.11 AOA Warning Tone. An AOA warning tone is provided to alert the pilot of excessive AOA
that may lead to aircraft settle and/or departure.
With flaps HALF or FULL, the AOA warning tone is triggered at 14° AOA with a 1 Hz pulse rate.
The tone pulse rate increases linearly as AOA approaches 35°, where the pulse rate remains constant
at 10 Hz.
With MC OFP H3E AND UP, with flaps AUTO, the AOA warning tone is triggered when the AOA
limits corresponding to the FLY lateral weight asymmetry are exceeded. A 500 ft-lb buffer is applied
to the lateral weight asymmetry threshold when triggering the tone to account for fuel slosh. If there
is an AOA failure, or more than one fuel quantity is invalid and/or weapon station indicates HUNG on
stations 2 − 10 (FLY value removed), the tone will not be triggered and the AOA TONE caution will
be displayed.
2.10.12 Spin Recovery System. The aircraft incorporates an automatic spin detection and recovery
system. A spin is declared when both of the following conditions are met: (1) airspeed is below
approximately 120 ±15 KCAS and (2) the yaw rate threshold is exceeded. The yaw rate threshold is
exceeded, for example, if a 15 to 20°/second yaw rate persists for approximately 15 seconds or a 50 to
60°/second yaw rate persists for approximately 2 seconds. For cases where the pilot is intentionally
commanding a high AOA roll (e.g., pirouette) the yaw rate threshold persistence is increased from 15
seconds to 25 seconds.
Immediately following a low-speed maneuver less than 77 KCAS (e.g., tail-slide), airspeed limits for
SPIN logic are opened to 180 KCAS or 12 seconds, whichever comes first. During this time, the normal
acceleration feedback gain is removed to avoid excess coupling, and spin mode arrows will be displayed
to aid recovery if yaw rate exceeds the threshold.
Once a spin has been detected, the spin recovery system places the SPIN MODE recovery displays
on both DDIs (figure 2-25), illuminates the amber FLAPS light, and drives the LEFs to 34° LED and
the TEFs to 4° TED. The displayed spin recovery arrow always indicates the proper direction for
anti-spin lateral stick inputs whether the spin is upright or inverted. Anti-spin lateral stick inputs are
aileron-into for upright spins and aileron-opposite for inverted spins. When lateral stick is placed with
the arrow, automatic spin recovery mode (ASRM) is engaged. With ASRM engaged, all CAS feedback
and control surface interconnects are removed, providing full aileron, rudder, and stabilator authority
for spin recovery. If the stick is neutral or is moved in the wrong direction, the SPIN MODE formats
remain displayed, the LEFs and TEFs remain deflected, but the FCS remains in CAS, and ASRM is
not engaged.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-76 ORIGINAL
If ASRM is engaged during spin recovery, the spin arrow is removed and the FCS automatically
reverts to CAS when either of the following conditions are met: (1) airspeed is above approximately 245
KCAS or (2) the yaw rate threshold is no longer exceeded. After recovery, LEFs and TEFs return to
normal scheduling, and the SPIN MODE formats are replaced with the MENU page after 2 seconds.
NOTE
During highly oscillatory spins or spins that transition from upright to
inverted or from inverted to upright, the SPIN MODE displays may
disappear momentarily.
2.10.12.1 Spin Recovery Displays. When the spin recovery system detects an upright left spin or an
inverted right spin, a left spin arrow appears on both DDIs to indicate the proper direction of the
anti-spin lateral stick input.

When the SPIN MODE formats appear on the DDIs, airspeed is always displayed in the upper left
corner, with altitude in the upper right and AOA in the lower center. See figure 2-23.
2.10.12.2 SPIN Switch. The SPIN switch is located on the right side of the main instrument panel.
The switch is guarded to prevent actuation. The SPIN switch was designed to allow for activation of
a manual spin recovery mode (MSRM). However, with all CAS feedback and control surface
interconnects removed, flight in MSRM will result in a departure and, once departed, will prevent
departure and/or spin recovery. SPIN arrow logic and ASRM functionality have been optimized and
thoroughly flight tested to produce accurate spin mode detection and positive spin recovery.
RCVY Prohibited.
NORM ASRM available when a spin is detected.
Selection of manual spin recovery mode (SPIN switch in RCVY) seriously degrades controllability, will prevent recovery from any departure
or spin, and is prohibited.
2.10.13 Stabilator Failure Control Law Reconfiguration. Stabilator reconfiguration consists of
additional control laws which augment baseline CAS control laws to compensate for the complete loss
of a single stabilator. Stabilator reconfiguration is automatically enabled following the detection of a
complete stabilator failure (3 or more FCS Xs in a single stabilator or a dual HYD circuit failure - HYD
1B/2A or 1A/2B). If hydraulics are intact, the failed stabilator is driven to 2° TEU and locked.
Following a dual HYD circuit failure, the failed stabilator must be driven to the locked position by
aiding airloads. If unaiding airloads are applied, actuator mechanization prevents the stabilator from
moving further away from the locked position.
The reconfigured control laws are designed to compensate for the loss of the pitch and roll
contribution of the failed stabilator. In the pitch axis, pitch commands to the remaining stabilator are
doubled to produce more pitching moment. In PA, rudder toe-in and rudder flare are also used to aid
the pitching moment capability of the remaining stabilator. In the roll axis, differential stabilator
commands are disabled. A stabilator-to-rolling-surface interconnect is used to compensate for the roll
generated by single stabilator movement. In PA, this interconnect is stabilator to aileron. In UA, it is
stabilator to aileron and differential TEF. At high airspeed in UA, differential LEFs are also used. In
the yaw axis, the baseline differential stabilator portion of the RSRI continues to be used to counter
the yaw generated by single stabilator movement.
2.10.14 GAIN ORIDE. GAIN ORIDE allows the pilot to select a set of fixed CAS gains when an FCS
malfunction prevents normal CAS gain scheduling (e.g., loss of AOA or pitot-static data). With the
GAIN switch in ORIDE, the FCCs use fixed values for speed, altitude, and AOA depending on the
position of the FLAP switch. These fixed gains cause the LEFs, TEFs, and aileron droop to be driven
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-78 ORIGINAL
to the fixed positions shown in figure 2-26. GAIN ORIDE should generally provide acceptable handling
qualities at flight conditions which approximate the fixed gains. At flight conditions that deviate from
the fixed gains, a slight degradation in handling qualities should be expected. Refer to chapter 11 for
details. The aircraft stalls at a lower than nominal AOA since the LEFs are fixed. Transition to or from
the landing configuration should be performed at 180 KCAS. For best results, maintain on-speed AOA
during the approach and landing.
Flight with GAIN ORIDE selected is prohibited above 10° AOA or above 350 KCAS (flaps AUTO),
200 KCAS (flaps HALF), or 190 KCAS (flaps FULL) to ensure control system stability and to reduce
the potential for departure. When GAIN ORIDE is selected, the amber FLAPS light comes on along
with either the CRUIS advisory (flaps AUTO) or the LAND advisory (flaps HALF or FULL). Alpha
tone is disabled in GAIN ORIDE.

2.10.15 FCS Failures. The FCS detects failures through three types of BIT: initiated (IBIT), periodic
(PBIT), and maintenance (MBIT). FCS IBIT is performed during Before Taxi Checks to run a
thorough test of the system prior to flight. PBIT is a less thorough test of the FCS and runs
continuously when other BITs are not running. MBIT is typically run by maintenance personnel and
is the most comprehensive test of the FCS.
FCS failures are annunciated by any or all of the following indications: the FCS caution, the FCES
caution light, the ″Flight controls, Flight controls″ voice alert, FCS format Xs, and/or BIT Logic
Inspection (BLIN) codes. FCS format Xs and BLIN codes identify the location and type of failure.
However, not all FCS related components/functions are covered by Xs on the FCS format matrix. For
such components/functions, valid BLIN codes may be the only indication of the location of the failure.
Therefore, until the nature of the failure is determined, BLIN codes that appear without Xs should be
treated with the same level of concern as those that do.
Typically, BLIN codes that have three digits or less are generated by PBIT, e.g., 341. Four digit and
five digit BLIN codes are generated by FCS IBIT, e.g., 4573 and 10165.
2.10.15.1 FCES Caution Light. The Flight Control Electronic Set (FCES) caution light is located on
the lower right caution lights panel. The primary purpose of the FCES caution light is to alert aircrew
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-79 ORIGINAL
of critical FCS related failures when MC1 is failed. When MC1 is failed, the normal DDI FCS related
cautions are not generated and the FCS format is not available for troubleshooting. When MC1 is
operative, the FCES caution light is merely a secondary indication of an FCS related failure. The
specific FCS cautions which also trigger the FCES caution light are listed in figure 2-27.
2.10.15.2 FCS RESET Button. The FCS RESET button is located on the FCS panel on the left
console. This button is used to perform several FCS related functions. Following detection of FCS
related hardware and/or software failures (e.g., FCS Xs and/or BLIN codes), pressing the FCS RESET
button commands a reset of FCC failure detection circuitry. If the FCS related failure was momentary
and no longer exists, an FCS RESET (a) restores the failed actuator/component, (b) removes all FCS
failure indications (FCS caution, FCES caution light, and Xs; preflight BLIN codes only), and (c)
displays the RSET advisory for 10 seconds to indicate a successful reset. If the failure remains (a) the
failed actuator/component is not restored, (b) the FCS failure indications return, and (c) the RSET
advisory is displayed for 10 seconds to indicate an unsuccessful reset. In other words, the FCS
RESET button does not fix a detected failure; it merely allows components to be
restored and failure indications to be removed, if and only if the failure no longer exists.
Prior to takeoff (cycle to WoffW), a successful FCS RESET automatically clears all BLIN codes.
Inflight or post-flight, however, BLIN codes are not automatically cleared with a successful FCS
RESET in order to preserve this data for maintenance troubleshooting. Inflight and post-flight BLIN
codes can be cleared, if desired, by pushing the FCS RESET button simultaneously with the paddle
switch.
Additionally, the FCS RESET button is used in conjunction with the FCS BIT consent switch to
enter the FCS exerciser mode.
2.10.15.3 FCS Exerciser Mode. The FCS exerciser mode is incorporated to aid hydraulic system
warming during cold weather starts. The exerciser mode allows hydraulic fluid and hydraulic seals to
warm towards normal operating temperatures without making large surface movements. Large surface
movements with a cold hydraulic system can result in hydraulic seal damage, leaks, and loss of fluid.
On the ground, the FCS exerciser mode is initiated by simultaneously holding the FCS BIT consent
switch in the ON position while pressing the FCS RESET button. When initiated, the mode cycles the
stabilators, flaps, ailerons, and rudders through 20% of full travel for 10 cycles in 20 seconds. The
operation can be stopped prior to 20 seconds by pressing the paddle switch.
During cold weather starts, avoid activating any hydraulic actuated system for two minutes after
both engines are online. This allows hydraulic fluid to warm both systems and prevents hydraulic seal
damage and potential hydraulic leaks. If the aircraft has not flown within 4 hours with ambient
temperatures below -18°C (0°F), up to three selections of the FCS exerciser mode may be required in
order to obtain a successful FCS RESET (after the initial 2 minute warmup).
In standard or warm conditions, do not initiate the FCS exerciser mode
multiple times in an attempt to get a successful FCS RESET. In such
conditions, multiple initiations may excessively elevate hydraulic system
temperatures, increasing actuator and hydraulic pump seal wear and
potentially decreasing component life.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-80 ORIGINAL
2.10.15.4 FCS BIT Consent Switch. The FCS BIT consent switch is located above the right console
beneath the right canopy sill. The switch is used in conjunction with the FCS BIT option or the FCS
RESET button to initiate FCS IBIT or the FCS exerciser mode, respectively. See the FCS Initiated
BIT (IBIT) section at the end of chapter 2 for details.
ON When held (for at least 2 seconds) during selection of the FCS option, initiates
FCS IBIT. When held during a press of the FCS RESET button, initiates FCS
exerciser mode.
OFF FCS IBIT and FCS exerciser mode not selected.

2.10.16 FCS Status Display. When an FCS failure has occurred, the FCS status display (figure 2-28)
can be used to determine the location and type of failure. The FCS status display is selected by the FCS
option on the SUPT MENU. For FCS components/functions which are displayed in the matrix, an ″X″
is displayed in the failed channel(s) along with a corresponding BLIN code. For FCS components/
functions which are not displayed in the matrix, BLIN codes are the only indication of failure location.
A. Surface Position: In degrees from streamline for all surfaces. Tolerance is ±1° for all surfaces.
B. Surface Arrow: Direction of surface deflection relative to the surface hinge point except for
stabilators. For stabilators, surface arrow indicates trailing edge position.
C. Column of Xs: An entire FCC channel is failed due to a processor fault or loss of power.
D. Bold X across surface position: Surface failed; FCCs are no longer commanding movement of
that surface in any channel.
E. G-LIMX.XG: ″X.X″ is the current Nz REF value as calculated by the MC. This value is
decremented if in the transonic g-bucket. INVALID is displayed in this position if the interface
between FCC CH 1, FCC CH 3, and the MC is invalid. In this case, all data on the display is invalid.
During FCS IBIT, G-LIM0.0G is displayed in this position.
F. Bold X over G-LIMX.XG: Nz REF data from the MC is invalid or out of range, and Nz REF has
defaulted to +7.5g. This X also appears when gross weight is above 57,405 lb, indicating that Nz REF
has been set to +5.5g even though this may result in an overstress.

G. BLIN Codes. Up to eight FCC BLIN codes are displayed in octal format for each channel. The codes are
displayed in the order of occurrence. If the list exceeds eight, additional codes may be viewed with a memory
inspect of unit 14 or 15 with address 2253.
In-flight Memory Inspect (MI) of FCC (UNIT 14 or 15) addresses (ADDR)
greater than six digits long is prohibited since it may cause all four FCC channels
to shut down which will result in loss of aircraft control.
H. BLIN Code Channel: The FCC channel corresponding to the list of BLIN codes. The channel is
incremented from 1 thru 4 and back to 1 by selecting the BLIN option.
I. L/R XX.X: FCC air data function corrected true AOA for the left and right AOA probes (see AOA Select in
paragraph K below).
J. AOA XX.X: True AOA based on INS data. INS true AOA is displayed for reference only to aid the pilot in
determining which AOA probe is valid when one is damaged. INS true AOA is normally boxed, indicating that
an average of the left and right probes has been selected for display in the HUD and for use by the AOA indexer
lights and approach lights.
K. AOA Select: The AOA option is displayed only when GAIN ORIDE is selected. If one AOA probe is
damaged, the AOA option can be used to select output from the good probe for display in the HUD and for use
by the AOA indexer lights and approach lights. AOA probe selection does not affect the fixed gains used by the
FCCs in GAIN ORIDE.
NOTE
If a single probe is declared invalid (a two channel AOA failure), and that
probe is selected, the AOA indexer lights and the HUD AOA are blanked
immediately.
L. DEGD Xs: An FCC failure has occurred in the Xd channel that is not covered by other matrix Xs. BLIN
codes should be used to determine the degraded FCC channel function.
M. PTS Xs: The static or total pressure data is failed in the Xd channel. If a three channel PTS failure occurs
(three Xs), the FCC control laws use data from the remaining PTS channel. If a total PTS failure occurs (four
Xs), the FCCs use fixed PTS values. If a PTS failure clears, PTS Xs are removed automatically with or without
an FCS RESET attempt.
NOTE
With a four channel PTS failure, HUD airspeed and altitude are blanked.
N. AOA Xs: AOA data failed in the Xd channel. A three or four channel AOA failure sets four Xs (AOA Four
Channel failure). In UA, P CAS uses the AOA estimator for control law scheduling. If a UA failure clears, AOA
Xs are removed automatically with or without an FCS RESET attempt. In PA, P CAS uses a fixed 8.1° AOA
value, and R CAS uses the AOA estimator for control law scheduling. If a PA failure clears, AOA Xs are not
removed until an FCS RESET is attempted.
O. Sensor Xs (CAS P, R, or Y; N ACC, L ACC, STICK, or PEDAL): The corresponding sensor (rate gyros,
normal or lateral accelerometers, stick or pedal position) is failed in the Xd channel. A three or four channel
sensor failure sets four Xs (total sensor failure). However, for a three channel failure, the FCCs average the
remaining channel with the last channel that failed. For N ACC and L ACC only, the FCCs use a single channel
if the signal from the third failed channel exceeds 90% of full range. A single X for CAS P, CAS R, or CAS Y is
not possible. Any single gyro failure in P, R, or Y sets Xs in CAS P, CAS R, and CAS Y for that channel. Similarly,
an AHRS acceleration failure sets Xs in the N ACC and L ACC for that channel. A failed AHRS sets Xs in all
five rows for that channel.

P. 1 2 3 4: Column legends for each FCC channel. FCC A contains channels 1 and 2 while FCC B
contains channels 3 and 4.
Q. Actuator Xs: The actuator is no longer commanded by the FCC in the Xd channel due to a
detected failure (for all actuators except spoilers). The actuator is still commanded by the other
operating channel(s).
R. SPOIL Xs: A single X is caused by a difference between commanded and actual position or by a
SOV over-current. If a two channel failure (two Xs) was caused by a difference between commanded
and actual position, the FCCs will continue to command the spoilers in both channels. This condition
is indicated by two Xs, a blanked surface position, and no bold surface position X. The vent surface
position value is always blanked.
S. Blank Surface Position: FCCs and/or MCs unable to report actuator position.
T. ROLL TRIM: With MC OFP H3E AND UP, roll trim is displayed in the right column with
WoffW. Arrows indicate trim direction. The roll trim value is dimensionless. Roll trim effects for the
same trim value are different at different airspeeds. The roll trim value provides a quantitative
measure of how much roll trim has been commanded.
U. PITCH TRIM: With MC OFP H3E AND UP, pitch trim is displayed in the left column with
WoffW. Arrows indicate trim direction. The pitch trim value is degrees AOA with flaps in HALF or
FULL and g-level with flaps in AUTO.
2.11 AFCS - AUTOMATIC FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM
The AFCS or autopilot provides three basic functions: pilot relief, coupled steering, and data link
control.
Different pilot relief modes are provided for the pitch and roll axes. Pitch-axis pilot relief modes
include barometric altitude hold (BALT), radar altitude hold (RALT), and flight path attitude hold
(FPAH). Roll-axis pilot relief modes include roll attitude hold (ROLL), ground track hold (GTRK),
ground track select (GSEL), heading hold (HDG), and heading select (HSEL).
Coupled steering modes allow the roll-axis to be coupled to a TACAN station (CPL TCN), to a
waypoint (CPL WYPT), to the azimuth steering line (CPL ASL), or to bank angle (CPL BNK).
Data link control modes include automatic carrier landing (ACL) and vector (VEC).
2.11.1 AFCS Mode Selection. Selection of the various autopilot (A/P) modes is accomplished from
the A/P sublevel of the CNI format on the UFCD. Before any autopilot mode can be selected, bank
angle must be less than 70°, pitch attitude must be less than 45°, and the A/P sublevel must be
displayed on the UFCD. The left column of the A/P sublevel displays the couple (CPL) option and the
pitch-axis pilot relief mode options: BALT, RALT, and FPAH. The right column displays the roll-axis
pilot relief mode options: ROLL, GTRK, and HDG. See figure 2-29.
An autopilot mode is enabled by selecting the corresponding option on the UFCD. Once selected, a
highlighted box appears around the option and the corresponding autopilot advisory appears on the
LDDI. If an option is not available, it is not displayed.
Once in the GTRK mode, subsequent selection of the GTRK option enables the GSEL mode (GSEL
replaces GTRK on the UFCD). Once in the HDG mode, subsequent selection of the HDG option
enables the HSEL mode (HSEL replaces HDG on the UFCD).

2.11.2 Basic Autopilot. The basic or default autopilot mode is FPAH/HDG. When any autopilot
mode is requested from the UFCD, the AFCS first engages FPAH/HDG and then engages the
requested mode. This makes sure that the AFCS is controlling both the pitch and roll axis whenever
an autopilot mode is engaged.
2.11.3 AFCS Mode Deselection. Autopilot modes can be disengaged by either reselecting (unboxing)
the UFCD option or by actuating the paddle switch. If an autopilot mode is unboxed on the UFCD, the
AFCS reverts to the basic autopilot mode in that axis and the AUTO PILOT caution illuminates. If the
stick is moved longitudinally with BALT or RALT engaged or laterally with CPL engaged, the AFCS
reverts to the basic autopilot mode in that axis as the AUTO PILOT caution illuminates. The basic
autopilot mode, however, cannot be disengaged (unboxed) from the UFCD and must, therefore, be
disengaged with the paddle switch. Paddle switch actuation is the only means to make sure that all
autopilot modes have been completely disengaged.
2.11.4 Pitch-Axis Pilot Relief Modes. Any of the pitch-axis pilot relief modes can be engaged in
conjunction with any coupled steering mode (except ACL) or with any roll-axis pilot relief mode.
However, only one pitch-axis mode can be selected at a time. If one pitch-axis mode is requested while
another is engaged, the AFCS switches to the requested mode.
2.11.4.1 BALT - Barometric Altitude Hold. When BALT is engaged, the baro-inertial altitude at the
time of engagement is captured and maintained. While the mode is engaged, this reference altitude
cannot be changed. Longitudinal stick inputs or trim changes disengage BALT, and the AFCS reverts
to FPAH and the selected roll-axis mode.
2.11.4.2 RALT - Radar Altitude Hold. RALT is not available above 5,000 feet AGL. When RALT is
engaged, the radar altitude at the time of engagement is captured and maintained. While the mode is
engaged, this reference altitude cannot be changed. Longitudinal stick inputs or trim changes
disengage RALT, and the AFCS reverts to FPAH and the selected roll-axis mode.
2.11.4.3 FPAH - Flight Path Angle Hold. When FPAH is engaged, the flight path angle at the time
of engagement is captured and maintained. This reference flight path angle can be changed by
longitudinal stick inputs (stick sensitivity similar to CAS) or by pitch trim changes (2°/sec in flaps
AUTO or 0.5°/second in flaps HALF or FULL). When pilot inputs cease, the flight path attitude at
release is captured and maintained.
2.11.5 Roll-Axis Pilot Relief Modes. Any of the roll-axis pilot relief modes can be engaged in
conjunction with any pitch-axis pilot relief mode. However, only one roll-axis mode can be engaged at
a time. If one roll-axis mode is requested while another is engaged, the AFCS switches to the requested
mode.
2.11.5.1 ROLL - Roll Attitude Hold. When ROLL is engaged, the roll attitude at the time of
engagement is captured and maintained. This reference roll attitude can be changed by lateral stick
inputs or roll trim changes (stick and trim sensitivity similar to CAS). When pilot inputs cease, the roll
attitude at release is captured and maintained.
2.11.5.2 GTRK - Ground Track Hold. When GTRK is engaged, aircraft response depends on the roll
attitude at the time of engagement. If roll attitude is less than ±5°, ground track is captured and
maintained. If roll attitude is greater than or equal to ±5°, roll attitude is captured and maintained.
While in GTRK, the aircraft responds to lateral stick or roll trim inputs (stick and trim sensitivity
similar to CAS). When pilot inputs cease, GTRK holds roll attitude (if greater than or equal to ±5°)
or ground track (if less than ±5°).
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-86 ORIGINAL
2.11.5.3 GSEL - Ground Track Select. The desired ground track angle is selected by slewing the
command heading marker with the HDG/TK switch, located to the left of the MPCD. When GSEL is
engaged, the aircraft turns from the existing ground track through the smallest angle to the selected
ground track. While in GSEL, the aircraft responds to lateral stick inputs. However, the selected
ground track angle is not changed by stick inputs, so the aircraft returns to the selected ground track
angle upon stick release.
2.11.5.4 HDG - Heading Hold. When HDG is engaged, aircraft response depends on the roll attitude
at the time of engagement. If roll attitude is less than ±5°, magnetic heading is captured and
maintained. If roll attitude is greater than or equal to ±5°, roll attitude is captured and maintained.
While in HDG, the aircraft responds to lateral stick or roll trim inputs (stick and trim sensitivity
similar to CAS). When pilot inputs cease, HDG holds roll attitude (if greater than or equal to ±5°) or
magnetic heading (if less than ±5°).
2.11.5.5 HSEL - Heading Select. The desired heading is selected by slewing the command heading
marker with the HDG/TK switch, located to the left of the MPCD. When HSEL is engaged, the
aircraft turns from the existing heading through the smallest angle to the selected heading. While in
HSEL, the aircraft responds to lateral stick inputs. However, the selected heading is not changed by
stick inputs, so the aircraft returns to the selected heading upon stick release.
2.11.6 CPL - Coupled Steering Modes. The coupled steering modes couple the aircraft in the
roll-axis only. If the CPL option is selected, the AFCS disengages any currently engaged roll-axis pilot
relief mode. The AFCS has the ability to couple to the following sources: a waypoint, waypoint
courseline, or offset aimpoint (CPL WYPT); to a TACAN station or TACAN courseline (CPL TCN);
or to an auto sequence (CPL SEQ#). Refer to chapter 24 for detailed navigation steering information
on waypoint/OAP, auto sequential, and TACAN steering.
2.11.7 Coupled Data Link Modes. The AFCS can couple to data link commands in one of two modes:
ACL and VEC. With ACL boxed on the HSI format, the CPL P/R option appears on the A/P sublevel
when pitch/roll couple capability is available. Selecting the CPL P/R option couples the aircraft to
pitch and roll commands for a Mode 1 carrier approach. With VEC boxed on the HSI format, selecting
the CPL option couples the aircraft (roll-axis only) to data link steering commands. Refer to chapter
24 and the Tactical Manual for detailed information on the ACL and VEC modes.
2.11.8 AFCS Related Caution and Advisories. The AUTO PILOT caution and the following AFCS
related advisories are described in the Warning/Caution/Advisory Displays in Part V:
• BALT
• CPLD
• FPAH
• GSEL
• GTRK
• HDG

2.12 WEAPON SYSTEMS CONTROLS
All of the primary controls for the aircraft’s weapon systems (weapons, sensors, and displays) are
located on the front cockpit throttles and stick, the rear cockpit throttles and stick (trainer configured
F/A-18F), or the rear cockpit hand controllers (missionized F/A-18F). This concept, hands on throttles
and stick (HOTAS), allows the aircrew to manipulate the weapon systems without removing the hands
from the aircraft’s primary flight controls. Additionally, the canopy sill DISP switch(es) and the rear
cockpit grab handle switches provide secondary controls for dispensing expendables from the ALE-47
self-protect system.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-87 ORIGINAL
Detailed descriptions of the functionality of the weapon systems controls are contained in the
Tactical Manual, F/A-18EA-TAC Series.
2.12.1 Stick Grip Switches/Controls (Front Cockpit). The weapon systems controls located on the
front cockpit stick grip are the A/A weapon select switch, the sensor control switch, the gun/missile
trigger, the A/G weapon release button, and the undesignate/NWS button. See figure 2-30.
2.12.1.1 A/A Weapon Select Switch. The A/A weapon select switch, located on the left side of the
stick grip, is spring loaded to the center/up position. The weapon select switch is used to select the
desired A/A weapon and can be used to enter A/A master mode. When the weapon select switch is
actuated while in NAV or A/G master mode, the A/A master mode is automatically entered, the RDR
ATTK format is automatically displayed on the RDDI, and the appropriate A/A weapon/radar format
is selected. Once in the A/A master mode, actuating the weapon select switch merely changes the
selected A/A weapon/radar format.
Center Neutral
Forward Selects AIM-7 and the corresponding radar format.
Down Selects AIM-9 and the corresponding radar format.
Aft Selects A/A GUN and the gun acquisition mode (GACG).
Inward Selects AIM-120 and the corresponding radar format.
Figure 2-30. Stick Grip Switches/Controls
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-88 ORIGINAL
Selection of an A/A missile initiates launch preparation of the priority missile, if more than one is
carried and brings up the corresponding radar format (e.g., scan volume presets). Subsequent selection
steps to the next available missile in the priority sequence.
2.12.1.2 Sensor Control Switch. The sensor control switch, commonly called the ″castle″ switch, is
located on the top center of the stick grip and is spring loaded to the center/up position. The castle
switch is used to assign throttle designator controller (TDC) priority to a particular cockpit display or,
once air combat maneuvering (ACM) mode functionality is enabled, to select a particular ACM mode.
Center Neutral
Forward Assigns TDC priority to the HUD in NAV or A/G master mode. In A/A
master mode, selects the boresight acquisition mode (BST) and enables
ACM mode functionality.
Forward (twice
within 0.5 seconds)
Selects/deselects EMCON.
Depress/release then
forward (within 1
second)
Assigns TDC priority to the UFCD in all master modes. If the top level
CNI, a CNI sublevel, or a data entry format is displayed, selects the last
displayed DDI format.
Left Assigns the TDC to the LDDI in all master modes. With ACM mode
functionality enabled in A/A master mode, selects the wide acquisition
mode (WACQ).
Right Assigns the TDC to the RDDI in all master modes. With ACM mode
functionality enabled in A/A master mode, selects the automatic acquisition mode (AACQ).
Aft Assigns the TDC to the MPCD in all master modes. With ACM mode
functionality enabled in A/A master mode, selects the vertical acquisition
mode (VACQ).
When the TDC is assigned to a display which cannot accept TDC priority, automatic format
initialization occurs, typically selecting the format which is most commonly used on that particular
display (e.g., RDR ATTK on the RDDI). With TDC assignment, certain displays (e.g., RDR ATTK,
FLIR, etc.) perform a specific action (e.g., track, break track, etc.) when the castle switch is
subsequently bumped toward that display.
2.12.1.3 Trigger. The gun/missile trigger, located on the front of the stick grip, has two detented
positions.
First
Detent
Initiates strike camera automatic mode operation (based on the selected A/G
weapon) and if CVRS is running, commands HUD recording.
Second
Detent
In A/A master mode, fires the gun or selected A/A missile. Activates AGI protection. In A/G master mode, fires the gun or the laser, if either is selected. Commands the HUD event marker.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-89 ORIGINAL
2.12.1.4 A/G Weapon Release Button. The A/G weapon release button, commonly called the
″pickle″, is located on the top center of the stick grip to the left of the castle switch. The pickle is used
to command weapon release while in A/G master mode. The pickle also initiates AGI protection, strike
camera automatic mode operation, and, if CVRS is running, commands HUD recording and the HUD
event marker.
2.12.1.5 Undesignate/NWS Button. The undesignate/NWS button is located on the lower front of
the stick grip. In NAV or A/G master mode, the undesignate button undesignates all A/G designated
targets and commands the radar and FLIR to break lock, if either is tracking. If TDC priority is
assigned to the FLIR format, pressing the button twice in 1 second selects/deselects FLIR velocity
vector slave (VVSLV) pointing mode. In A/A master mode, the undesignate button creates a launch
and steering (L&S) target designation. Subsequent actuation steps target designation to the next
priority trackfile or to a second designated trackfile (DT2), if one exists. If ACM mode functionality is
enabled, the undesignate button exits the ACM mode and returns the radar to the previous search
mode.
2.12.2 Stick Grip Switches/Controls (Trainer Configured F/A-18F). In the F/A-18F (trainer
configuration), the front and rear cockpit stick grips are identical. However, the rear cockpit trigger
and A/G weapon release button are not functional. The rear cockpit A/A weapon select switch does not
automatically select A/A master mode. From the rear cockpit, A/A master mode must be entered by
actuation of the A/A master mode light. The front and rear cockpit control sensor switches are
functionally identical, including ACM mode selection. However, the rear cockpit TDC can be assigned
to a sensor different from the front cockpit TDC. The systems controlled by the stick grip
switches/controls respond to the last crewmember action taken from either cockpit.
2.12.3 Throttle Grip Switches/Controls (Front Cockpit). The weapon systems controls located on
the front cockpit throttle grips are the chaff/flare/ALE-50 dispense switch, the cage/uncage button, the
throttle designator controller (TDC), the radar elevation control, and the raid button. See figure 2-31.
2.12.3.1 Chaff/Flare/ALE-50 Dispense Switch. The chaff/flare/ALE-50 dispense switch is located
on the top inboard side of the right throttle. The switch is used to dispense expendables from the
ALE-47 and ALE-50 self-protect systems.
Figure 2-31. Throttle Grip Switches/Controls (Front Cockpit)

Forward Provides semi-automatic consent. Dispenses chaff singles (C/F mode).
Aft Initiates the selected manual program. Dispenses flare singles (C/F mode).
Up Dispenses a single ALE-50 decoy and provides transmit enable.
Down Not functional
2.12.3.2 Cage/Uncage Button. The cage/uncage button is located on the rear inboard side of the
right throttle. In NAV master mode and A/G master mode (AUTO delivery), the cage/uncage button
is used to cage and uncage the velocity vector. Depending on master mode and TDC priority
assignment, the cage/uncage button can be used to (1) cage/uncage weapons, (2) command a radar
STT, (3) toggle between weapon modes, or (4) reset sequenced HARM targets.
(18E OFP) With the velocity vector caged, data such as the flight path/pitch ladder and steering
information is displayed near the center of the HUD despite large yaw rates and/or crosswind angles.
2.12.3.3 TDC - Throttle Designator Controller. The TDC is located on the front right side of the
right throttle. It is used to control the positioning of the acquisition cursor or the slewing of a particular
sensor or weapon (e.g., FLIR or Maverick). The TDC can be pressed for target designation. When held
pressed (action slew) or released (no-action slew), the fore-aft and left-right movement of the TDC
sends X-Y slew commands to the display or to the sensor/weapon to which TDC priority is assigned.
2.12.3.4 Radar Elevation Control. The radar elevation control is located on the front left side of the
right throttle. Momentary actuation changes the elevation of the radar antenna in 1,000 foot
increments at the range where the cursor is positioned on the RDR ATTK format. Press and hold
produces a faster elevation change.
Up Raises the radar antenna/scan volume.
Center Neutral
Down Lowers the radar antenna/scan volume.
2.12.3.5 RAID Button. The RAID button is located on the left side of the left throttle. Depending on
master mode and TDC priority assignment, the RAID button can be used to (1) sequence between
available HARM targets, (2) toggle between narrow and wide field of view (FOV) for the FLIR or
Maverick, or (3) select/deselect the STT RAID or SCAN RAID radar modes.
2.12.4 Throttle Grip Switches/Controls (Trainer Configured Rear Cockpit). The rear cockpit
throttle grips contain the same weapon systems controls as those in the front cockpit, except no
chaff/flare/ALE-50 switch is installed. The systems controlled by the throttle grip switches/controls
respond to the last crewmember action taken from either cockpit.
2.12.5 Hand Controllers (Missionized Rear Cockpit Lots 21 thru 25). Two hand controllers are
installed in the rear cockpit, one on the front inboard section of each console. With the exception of
weapons release, the hand controllers are used to provide the same weapon systems control as stick and
throttle switches/controls do in the front cockpit. The right hand controller is a mirror image of the left
hand controller. Each contains a multi-function switch (MFS), a designator controller (DC) assignment
switch, a designator controller (DC), a radar elevation control, a chaff/flare dispense switch, and an
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-91 ORIGINAL
undesignate button. Except for the chaff/flare dispense switches, the functions of the left and right
hand controllers are identical. See figure 2-32.
2.12.5.1 Multi-Function Switch (MFS). The MFS is located on the lower inboard side of each hand
controller. The MFS provides the same functionality as the front cockpit RAID and cage/uncage
buttons.
Forward Sequences between available HARM targets.
Aft Cages/uncages an A/G weapon.
Down Selects RAID or changes FLIR/Maverick FOV.
Forward Not functional
2.12.5.2 Designator Controller (DC) Assignment Switch. The DC assignment switch is located on
the top inboard side of each hand controller. It is used to assign left and right DC priority to the
displays in the rear cockpit. ACM modes cannot be selected by the rear cockpit DC assignment
switches.
Forward Commands FLIR track/break lock if opposite DC is assigned to the FLIR format.
Aft Assigns DC priority to the AUFCD.
Inboard Assigns DC priority to the AMPCD
Outboard Assigns DC priority to the outboard ADDI. Following DC assignment, commands
track/break lock on the outboard format.
Each DC is initially assigned to its corresponding ADDI. One but not both DCs can be assigned to
one of the center displays, AUFCD or AMPCD. If one DC is assigned to the AMPCD, the other is
forced back to its corresponding ADDI.
2.12.5.3 Designator Controller (DC). The DC is located on the top center of each hand controller.
The track and slew functions of the rear cockpit DCs are identical to the front cockpit TDC. While only
one hand controller DC can be used to designate at a time, both DCs may be used simultaneously on
their assigned formats.
If the front cockpit TDC and the rear cockpit DC are both assigned to the same format, control is
captured by the first controller actuated. If one controller is active when another is selected, the second
input is ignored. If both front and rear TDC/DCs are pressed simultaneously, the TDC/DC assignment
diamond, located in the upper right corner of the specific format, flashes. If both front and rear
TDC/DCs are being slewed simultaneously, the SLEW cue is displayed and flashed.
2.12.5.4 Radar Elevation Control. The radar elevation control is located on the top outboard side of
each hand controller. The front and rear cockpit radar elevation controls are functionally identical.
Control of the radar antenna is captured by the first elevation control actuated from either cockpit. If
one control is active when another is selected, the second input is ignored.

controller. The front and rear undesignate buttons are functionally identical, except the rear cockpit
buttons do not command NWS.
2.12.6 Hand Controllers (Rear Cockpit LOT 26 AND UP). The functions of the left and right hand
controllers are not identical. The left hand controller contains the following switches: Countermeasures, Growth, Sensor Weapons Control, Designator Control Assignment, A/G Weapon Release, Left
Trigger, ECM, and Cage. The right hand controller contains the following switches: HARM, Display
Scroll/Toggle, FOV Wheel, Designator Control, A/A Weapon Release, A/A Weapon Select, Undesignate, and Right Trigger. See figure 2-32 Sheet 2. Refer to Tactical Manuals for complete Hand
controller Switch description.
2.12.7 ALE-47 DISP Switch. An ALE-47 DISP switch is located on the left canopy sill in both front
and rear cockpits. Either switch can be used to initiate manual program 6 or to dispense chaff and flare
singles (C/F mode).
2.12.8 Grab Handle Chaff/Flare Dispense Switches (Rear Cockpit LOTs 21 thru 25). The grab
handle dispense switches are located on the left and right ends of the center grab handle in the rear
cockpit. These switches provide a secondary means to dispense expendables from the ALE-47
self-protect system.
Forward Provides semi-automatic consent. Dispenses flare singles (C/F mode)
Aft Initiates the selected manual program. Dispenses flare singles (C/F mode)
Inboard Initiates manual program 6. Dispenses chaff and flare singles (C/F mode)
Outboard Initiates manual program 6. Dispenses chaff and flare singles (C/F mode)
2.12.9 Grab Handle Chaff/Flare Dispense Switches (Rear Cockpit LOT 26 and up). The grab
handle dispense switches are located on the left end of the left grab handle and the right end of the
right grab handle in the rear cockpit. Switch function is the same as described above.
2.13 ECS - ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL SYSTEM
The environmental control system (ECS) utilizes engine bleed air to provide pressurization, heating
and cooling air to various aircraft systems. Warm air is provided for internal fuel tank pressurization
(LOT 23 and below), external fuel tank pressurization, canopy seal inflation, g-suit operation, radar
waveguide pressurization, windshield anti-ice and rain removal, gun gas purge, RECCE bay heating,
and on-board oxygen generating system (OBOGS) operation. Cold, dry conditioned air is provided for
avionics cooling. Warm and cold air are mixed to provide temperature controlled air for cabin heating,
cooling, and pressurization and windshield defog.
A liquid cooling system (LCS) is used to cool the radar transmitter. A digital ECS controller is used
to schedule ECS output, regulate system temperatures, monitor system health, and detect and isolate
faults. See foldout section for a schematic of the ECS. Items numbers, listed in ( ) next to ECS valves,
are maintenance and MSP code nomenclature.
2.13.1 Bleed Air Shutoff Valves. Engine bleed air is tapped from the final (seventh) stage of the
engine high pressure compressor. A primary bleed air pressure regulator and shutoff valve (Item 1), one
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-95 ORIGINAL
on each engine, is used to regulate bleed air output pressure as well as to control flow application/
shutoff.
Both valves are electrically controlled by the BLEED AIR knob and are pneumatically actuated.
The primary bleed air shutoff valves failsafe to the closed position if either electrical power or air
pressure is lost. If an engine is shut down before placing the BLEED AIR knob to OFF, the
corresponding primary bleed air shutoff valve may not fully close, resulting in residual engine fumes
in the cabin on subsequent start of that engine.
Bleed air from each engine passes through a check valve, which prevents reverse flow, and is mixed
through a Y-junction prior to the secondary bleed air pressure regulator and shutoff valve (Item 2).
This valve is electrically controlled by the OFF and AUG PULL positions of the BLEED AIR knob and
is pneumatically actuated. The secondary bleed air shutoff valve fails to the open (safe) position if
either electrical power or air pressure is lost.
All three valves can be automatically commanded to the closed position by the bleed air leak
detection (BALD) system.
2.13.1.1 BLEED AIR Knob. The BLEED AIR knob, located on the ECS panel on the right console, is
used to select the engine bleed air source for the ECS system.
NORM Commands both primary bleed air shutoff valves open, selecting bleed air from both
engines.
L OFF Commands the left primary bleed air shutoff valve closed, selecting bleed air from the
right engine only.
R OFF Commands the right primary bleed air shutoff valve closed, selecting bleed air from the
left engine only.
OFF Commands all three bleed air shutoff valves closed, isolating the ECS. Closes the ECS
auxiliary duct doors.
AUG
PULL
Commands the secondary bleed air shutoff valve closed, opens the ECS air isolation
valve, and allows APU compressor air to operate the ECS.
2.13.1.2 L or R BLD OFF Cautions. The L or R BLD OFF cautions indicate that the corresponding
primary bleed air shutoff valve(s) are commanded closed. The cautions are not an indication of actual
valve position. The L and/or R BLD OFF cautions are displayed in the following circumstances:
a. BLEED AIR knob in L OFF, R OFF, or OFF (L, R, or both cautions).
b. ENG CRANK switch in L or R (L or R caution, respectively).
c. BALD system detects a leak in one or both bleed air systems (L, R, or both cautions).
d. FIRE switch in TEST A or TEST B (both cautions).
e. Over pressurization in one or both bleed air systems (both cautions).
If a bleed air shutoff valve has been commanded closed other than by ENG CRANK, the BLEED
AIR knob must be cycled to OFF and back to NORM to reopen the valve(s).
2.13.2 Bleed Air Subsystem. Engine bleed air downstream of the secondary bleed air shutoff valve
is routed to the primary heat exchanger and three valves. The primary heat exchanger is used for first
stage cooling of hot engine bleed air. The ECS air isolation valve directs bleed air to the air turbine
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-96 ORIGINAL
starter control valves (ATSCV) for crossbleed start and accepts air from the APU compressor for
alternate (AUG PULL) ECS operation. On the ground and during slow speed flight, the ejector shutoff
valve is opened to direct bleed air to the ram air ejectors to induce cooling airflow through the primary
and secondary heat exchangers. The warm air temperature control valve is used to mix uncooled engine
bleed air with primary heat exchanger output air to regulate the temperature of air in the warm air
manifold.
2.13.3 Primary Heat Exchanger. The primary heat exchanger is located near the base of the right
vertical tail and is used to reject heat from engine bleed air to ram air from one of two inlets.
During medium to high speed flight, ram air cooling is provided by the main ram inlet which draws
air from the engine intake. During slow speed flight and ground operations, ram air cooling is provided
by an auxiliary ram inlet which draws free stream air from the top of the fuselage. A ram air ejector in
the ram air exhaust duct is used to induce more airflow when required, such as on the the ground,
during slow speed flight, and during windshield anti-ice operation with either throttle above IDLE.
2.13.3.1 ECS Auxiliary Duct Doors. Two ECS auxiliary duct doors are located on the upper surface
of the fuselage forward of the base of the vertical tails and immediately in front of the primary and
secondary heat exchangers. The ECS auxiliary duct doors are electrically actuated and open into the
free stream, closing the main ram air inlets and exposing the auxiliary ram air inlets.
On the ground, the ECS auxiliary duct doors are open with the BLEED AIR knob in any position
except OFF. Inflight, the doors are positioned based on Mach number and throttle setting. The doors
are always open below Mach 0.33 and are always closed above Mach 0.40. Between Mach 0.35 and Mach
0.40, the doors are open if either throttle is near MIL (THA greater than 25°).
The ECS auxiliary duct doors should operate symmetrically. If either ECS auxiliary duct door is not
in the commanded position for greater than 8 seconds, an ECS DR advisory is displayed along with an
ECS BIT indication of DEGD. If the door(s) return to the commanded position, the ECS DR advisory
is removed.
2.13.3.2 Ram Air Exhausts. The ECS ram air exhausts are located on the upper fuselage just aft of
the leading edge of the vertical tails. There is one exhaust for the primary heat exchanger (right side)
and one for the secondary heat exchanger (left side). These exhausts discharge the heated ram air
overboard. The exhausts have been redesigned to a five swept stack configuration to prevent
overheating of the aft fuselage structure.
2.13.4 Warm Air Subsystems. Air leaves the primary heat exchanger at a greatly reduced temperature. Warm air from the primary heat exchanger is routed directly to the following systems: internal
fuel tank pressurization (LOT 23 and below), external fuel tank pressurization, canopy seal, g-suit,
radar waveguide pressurization, and OBOGS.
The ECS controller modulates the warm air temperature control valve (Item 21) to mix air from the
primary heat exchanger with uncooled engine bleed air to regulate the temperature in the warm air
manifold. The warm air manifold supplies air for windshield anti-ice and rain removal, gun gas purge,
RECCE bay heating, ECS turbine anti-ice, and cabin heating.
2.13.5 Air Conditioning System (ACS) Pack. The ACS pack provides cold, dry conditioned air for
cabin, FLIR, and avionics cooling. The primary components of the ACS pack are a compressor, turbine,
condenser, reheater and water extractor.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-97 ORIGINAL
The ECS controller modulates airflow through the ECS flow modulator valve (Item 4) to control
ECS flow and the speed of the ECS compressor and turbine. Compressor discharge air is directed to
the secondary heat exchanger for additional cooling. Cooled air from the secondary heat exchanger is
directed to the ECS turbine and is used as another source of OBOGS air inflight.
Expansion through the ECS turbine drives the compressor and greatly reduces the temperature of
the airflow, typically to below freezing. The ECS controller regulates the ECS turbine output
temperature and prevents ECS icing by adding warm air through the anti-ice add heat valve (Item 51).
Output temperature is regulated during low altitude operations where ECS icing would be likely.
The condenser, reheater and water extractor remove water from the cold conditioned air. With the
large heat load of the APG-79 radar, the condenser can run at sub−freezing conditions. During
prolonged operation of the APG-79 in high humidity conditions with warm fuel temperatures, periodic
automatic deicing of the condenser occurs. During de-icing, a short term increase in cabin supply air
temperature may be noticed.
In LOT 26 and up, at altitudes above 40,000 feet the water removal system may be bypassed by
opening the water extractor bypass valve (Item 171) in order to improve ECS operating efficiency. If
this valve fails to close after descending below 37,000 feet, water removal capability is degraded. Water
or ice pellets may be blown into the cabin and erratic system behavior (flow/pressure surges) may
result. An ECS ICING caution may also occur.
2.13.6 Secondary Heat Exchanger. The secondary heat exchanger is located near the base of the left
vertical tail and is used to reject heat from ECS compressor air to ram air. Operation of the secondary
heat exchanger is identical to operation of the primary heat exchanger. However, excess ECS system
moisture is sprayed onto the secondary heat exchanger to increase system cooling. This moisture may
be seen exiting the secondary heat exchanger exhaust duct when the throttles are advanced during
ground operations.
2.13.7 Avionics Cooling Fans. Two avionic cooling fans augment ECS cooling of avionics. The
avionics ground cooling fan is located in the nosewheel well. The aft avionics cooling fan is located in
door 108. These fans normally provide primary avionics cooling on deck, and also provide contingency
avionics cooling in flight. Fan activation is a function of bleed air pressure, which varies with engine N2
rpm (i.e. throttle position). Fan operation is described in the individual ECS mode descriptions.
2.13.7.1 Aft Cooling Fan Shutoff Valve. The aft cooling fan shutoff valve, when closed, secures flow
from the aft avionics cooling fan into the ECS and also prevents ECS backflow to the aft avionics
cooling fan. If this valve fails (indicated by MSP 863) while in the open position then, depending on
system pressure, ECS backflow can overspeed the fan in the wrong direction. This may cause a
structural failure of the fan and result in collateral fragment damage to adjacent systems. ECS
backflow is most likely to occur when ECS MAN mode is selected and ECS flow is commanded by
default to maximum.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-98 ORIGINAL
Selection of ECS MAN mode is prohibited. Selecting ECS MAN mode
while the aft cooling fan shutoff valve is open may cause the fan to
overspeed, resulting in a catastrophic fan failure and potential loss of
OBOGS.
2.13.8 ECS Operating Modes. The ECS has three operating modes: AUTO, MAN (manual) (PROHIBITED), and OFF/RAM. Each mode is selected by the corresponding position of the ECS MODE
switch. On the ground only, APU compressor air may be used instead of engine bleed air to run the ECS
and cool the avionics (BLEED AIR knob in AUG PULL).
2.13.8.1 ECS AUTO Mode. ECS AUTO mode is the normal operating mode of the ECS. The ECS
controller modulates ECS output to provide the required airflow to the cabin and the avionics. Cabin
airflow is scheduled as a function of ram air temperature and throttle setting, with the highest flow
delivered at hot and cold temperature extremes. Cabin flow may decrease at IDLE. ECS flow to the
avionics is dependent on WonW status, throttle setting, Lot number, and radar configuration. For all
aircraft configurations, more air is provided to avionics inflight.
With APG−73 radar installed, WonW and both throttles at IDLE, the avionics ground cooling fan
and the aft avionics cooling fan energize. With APG−79 radar installed, WonW and both throttles at
IDLE, only the avionics ground cooling fan energizes. The fan(s) provide the primary source of avionics
cooling on deck. The ECS provides a second source of ground avionics cooling but at a fixed, low flow
rate with the remainder of the flow going to the cabin.
With WonW and at least one throttle advanced to approximately 74% N2 rpm, or with WoffW, the
fan(s) secure. Once secured, the fan(s) will not reenergize until both throttles are retarded below
approximately 70% N2 rpm. With WonW and fans secured, the ECS provides all avionics cooling and
controls to the cabin and avionics airflow schedules. The ECS controller schedules avionics airflow
based on the temperature of the air being delivered (warmer air requires higher flow to maintain
constant cooling).
The ECS controller modulates airflow output to meet scheduled airflow requirements. ECS output
temperature is scheduled by the ECS controller to meet avionics cooling requirements and to prevent
ECS turbine icing. Temperature is regulated by adding warm air as required. The controller divides the
airflow between the cabin and avionics. Inflight, if ECS output is inadequate for demand, cabin airflow
is normally given priority. The avionics typically receive that portion of the ECS output which is not
used by the cabin or FLIR cooling systems.
Cabin temperature is controlled by gradually mixing warm air with cold conditioned air, according
to the position of the CABIN TEMP knob. Cabin temperature is normally selectable in the range of
35 to 135° F between the CABIN TEMP knob positions of COLD and HOT, respectively (60 to 160°
F with the DEFOG handle in the HIGH position).
NOTE
In ECS AUTO mode, cabin temperature may take 1 to 2 minutes to
stabilize following a large movement of the CABIN TEMP knob.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-99 ORIGINAL
2.13.8.2 ECS MAN Mode.
Selection of ECS MAN mode is prohibited. Selecting ECS MAN mode
while the aft cooling fan shutoff valve is open may cause the fan to
overspeed, resulting in a catastrophic fan failure and potential loss of
OBOGS.
2.13.8.3 ECS OFF/RAM Mode. ECS OFF/RAM mode is used to terminate normal ECS operation
following a major ECS malfunction. Conditioned ECS air is terminated, the cabin ram air scoop is
deployed, and if inflight the aft avionics cooling fan energizes.
NOTE
If ECS OFF/RAM mode is selected inflight, the AV COOL switch
should be placed in EMERG to deploy the FCS emergency ram air
scoop and maximize the emergency avionics cooling available.
Partial cabin pressurization is provided, but only if the CABIN TEMP knob is above the full COLD
position. Cabin airflow and pressurization is provided by ram air from the cabin ram air scoop. Ram
air supply varies with inflight dynamic conditions (airspeed and altitude), and cabin airflow and
pressurization vary similarly.
In ECS OFF/RAM mode, avoid operations above 25,000 feet MSL in
order to prevent decompression sickness (DCS). Normal cabin pressurization is not provided. Partial cabin pressurization is available under
certain circumstances, but may be lost insidiously without warning.
Inflight, cabin temperature is no longer automatically controlled. The CABIN TEMP knob
manually controls addition of heated air according to the CABIN TEMP knob. Temperature control
in between the full COLD and full HOT positions is difficult and imprecise, and ECS response to
commanded temperature changes is slow and nonlinear.
NOTE
In ECS OFF/RAM mode, changes in the position of the CABIN
TEMP knob should be held for 30 seconds due to a slower temperature
response.
With the CABIN TEMP knob not in full COLD, cabin temperature varies with throttle position and
flight condition. System flow/temperature cycling can be expected with the CABIN TEMP knob in full
HOT since overtemperature protection operates intermittently.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-100 ORIGINAL
With WonW and both throttles at IDLE, the avionics ground cooling fan and the aft avionics cooling
fan provide the only source of avionics cooling. Above approximately 74% N2 rpm, both fans secure,
and avionics equipment is deprived of all cooling (AV AIR HOT caution).
NOTE
During ground operations in the ECS OFF/RAM mode, the throttles
should be kept below 70% N2 rpm whenever possible in order to
preserve avionics cooling. If either throttle must be advanced above
approximately 74% N2 rpm more than momentarily or if an AV AIR
HOT caution is present, placing the BLEED AIR knob to OFF
reenergizes both fans and provides avionics cooling.
Inflight, the aft avionics cooling fan and the FCS emergency ram air scoop (with AV COOL in
EMERG) provide emergency avionics cooling.
NOTE
With the FCS emergency ram air scoop extended, avionics cooling
inflight is maximized by maintaining altitude below 25,000 feet MSL
and airspeed between 200 to 300 KCAS.
2.13.8.4 AUG PULL. With both generators online and the APU running, selecting AUG PULL (up
on the BLEED AIR knob):
a. overrides APU automatic shutdown
b. closes the secondary bleed air shutoff valve.
c. opens the ECS air isolation valve.
d. shuts down the aft avionics cooling fans.
e. and directs APU air to the ECS for cabin and avionics cooling.
2.13.8.5 ECS MODE Switch. The ECS MODE switch, located on the ECS panel on the right console,
is used to select the ECS operating mode.
AUTO Selects ECS AUTO mode, the normal ECS operating mode. Provides automatic
cabin and avionics airflow, automatic temperature scheduling, and full cabin pressurization.
MAN PROHIBITED
Selection of ECS MAN mode is prohibited. Selecting ECS MAN mode
while the aft cooling fan shutoff valve is open may cause the fan to
overspeed, resulting in a catastrophic fan failure and potential loss of
OBOGS.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-101 ORIGINAL
OFF/RAM Selects ECS OFF/RAM mode, which terminates conditioned ECS airflow. Provides
ram air for cabin airflow and pressurization depending on flight conditions, and
manual temperature control.
2.13.8.6 CABIN TEMP knob. The CABIN TEMP knob, located on the ECS panel on the right
console, is used to control the temperature of air delivered to the cabin. In ECS AUTO mode, clockwise
rotation of the CABIN TEMP knob linearly increases cabin temperature. In ECS OFF/RAM mode, the
CABIN TEMP knob controls the cabin add heat valve directly, producing a nonlinear temperature
response.
NOTE
• In ECS AUTO mode, cabin temperature may take 1 to 2 minutes to
stabilize following a large movement of the CABIN TEMP knob.
• In ECS OFF/RAM mode, changes in the position of the CABIN
TEMP knob should be held for 30 seconds due to a slower temperature response.
2.13.8.7 Cabin Louvers/Foot Air Outlet. Three sets of louvers are provided to direct airflow within
the cabin, one on either side of the main instrument panel and one at the base of the center console
behind the control stick. The left and right louvers have controls for elevation and azimuth. The center
louver has a single control for elevation and can be closed completely by moving the lever to the full
aft position. When the center louver is closed, airflow through the left and right louvers is increased.
Maximum aircrew cooling is provided by pulling the DEFOG HANDLE full aft, closing the center
louver, and directing the side louvers towards the body. A fixed foot air outlet directs airflow to the
base of the cabin.
2.13.8.8 Windshield Defog Outlets Fixed windshield defog outlets direct cabin air onto the inner
windshield to remove and inhibit fog. Windshield fogging can occur during rapid environmental
changes, such as high rates of descent and high humidity.
2.13.8.9 DEFOG Handle. The DEFOG handle, located on the right console outboard of the ECS
panel, controls the division of airflow between the windshield defog outlets, the three cockpit louvers,
and the foot air outlet. The DEFOG handle mechanically controls the position of the cabin air/defog
diverter valve.
HIGH Directs all cabin airflow to the windshield defog outlets to maximize defog, and
increases the temperature range controlled by the CABIN TEMP knob in ECS AUTO
mode.
NORM Equally divides cabin airflow between the cabin louvers/foot air outlet and the windshield defog outlets. Provides adequate windshield defog for most conditions.
LOW Directs all cabin airflow to the cabin louvers and the foot air outlet to maximize cabin
cooling.

2.13.9 Cabin Pressurization. The cabin is pressurized using airflow from the cabin heating and
cooling system. Cabin pressurization is controlled by the CABIN PRESS switch and automatic
operation of the cabin pressure regulator. Cabin pressure altitude is displayed on a cabin pressure
altimeter.
Cabin pressure is controlled by the cabin pressure regulator which regulates exit airflow to maintain
a pressure/altitude schedule. The cabin is unpressurized from sea level to an aircraft altitude of 8,000
feet. Between 8,000 and 24,500 feet aircraft altitude, cabin pressure is maintained at a constant 8,000
feet. Above 24,500 feet, cabin altitude increases slowly to approximately 14,500 feet at 35,000 feet
aircraft altitude and 20,000 feet at 50,000 feet aircraft altitude. A rule of thumb for cabin altitude above
24,500 feet aircraft altitude is aircraft altitude x 0.4.
A cabin safety and dump valve is incorporated to limit cabin pressure if the pressure regulator fails.
When the CABIN PRESS switch is placed to DUMP or RAM/DUMP, the cabin safety and dump valve
opens to release pressure to the cabin pressure regulator, reducing cabin pressure to ambient.
In ECS OFF/RAM mode, avoid operations above 25,000 feet MSL in
order to prevent decompression sickness (DCS). Normal cabin pressurization is not provided. Partial cabin pressurization is available under
certain circumstances, but may be lost insidiously without warning.
2.13.9.1 CABIN PRESS Switch. The CABIN PRESS switch, located on the ECS panel on the right
console, is used to control cabin pressurization. The switch is lever-locked in the NORM position.
NORM Automatically regulates cabin pressurization according to the cabin pressure schedule
using the cabin pressure regulator (ECS AUTO mode).
DUMP Dumps cabin pressurization. Normal ECS airflow to the cabin and the avionics is not
affected.
RAM/
DUMP
Dumps cabin pressurization. Terminates all ECS airflow to the cabin by closing the
cabin flow valve (Item 9). Cabin airflow is provided by the cabin ram air scoop. Avionics airflow is provided by a simplified control scheme.
2.13.9.2 Cabin Pressure Altimeter. A cabin pressure altimeter, located on the center console in the
front cockpit and the lower left instrument panel in the rear cockpit, displays the current cabin
pressure altitude.
2.13.9.3 Cabin Pressurization Warning System (CPWS). The CPWS pressure switch monitors cabin
pressure and aircraft relays monitor related controls to warn aircrew of potentially hazardous cabin
pressurization conditions.
2.13.9.3.1 CABIN Caution Light. The yellow CABIN caution light is located on the lower right
caution lights panel. The light illuminates when cabin pressure altitude is above 21,000 +/- 1,100 feet.
The light may not extinguish until cabin pressure altitude is below 16,500 feet.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-103 ORIGINAL
• CABIN light may appear with normal cabin pressurization when
aircraft altitude is above 47,000 feet MSL. If altitude is maintained,
aircrew should continuously monitor physiological condition.
• DCS may be experienced when operating with cabin pressure altitude
above 25,000 feet even with a working oxygen system. Symptoms of
DCS include pain in joints, tingling sensations, dizziness, paralysis,
choking, and/or loss of consciousness.
NOTE
There is no corresponding DDI caution for the CABIN caution light.
2.13.9.3.2 CK ECS Caution Light. The yellow CK ECS caution light is located on the lower right
caution lights panel. The light illuminates when the position of cabin pressurization related controls
will inhibit cabin pressurization.
NOTE
There is no corresponding DDI caution for the CK ECS caution light.
2.13.10 Windshield Anti-ice and Rain Removal. The windshield anti-ice and rain removal systems
use the same air nozzle to direct warm air over the external windshield in order to improve pilot
forward visibility in icing/raining conditions. Warm air is provided by mixing engine bleed air with
output from the primary heat exchanger. Windshield air nozzle orientation is intended to affect (in
flight) an area roughly 20 inches to the left and 9 inches to the right of centerline at design eye level
and below. System operation is controlled by the WINDSHIELD switch.
2.13.10.1 WINDSHIELD Switch. The WINDSHIELD switch, located on the right console outboard of
the ECS panel, is used to select either windshield anti-ice or rain removal. The switch is lever-locked
to the OFF position.
ANTI
ICE
Delivers a high flow rate of 290 ±20°F air to the external surface of the windshield.
OFF Terminates anti-ice/rain removal airflow.
RAIN Delivers a low flow rate of 270 ±20°F air to the external surface of the windshield.
2.13.11 Anti-g System. The anti-g system delivers air pressure to the g-suit proportional to sensed
load factor. A button in the anti-g valve allows the aircrew to test system operation by manually
inflating the anti-g suit. The system incorporates a pressure relief valve to prevent over-pressurization.

2.13.12 ECS RESET and AV COOL Switch.
2.13.12.1 ECS RESET. If the ECS is DEGD, selecting the ECS RESET option from the BIT/
HYDRO-MECH display commands an ECS controller software reset and may restore normal
functionality following a transient fault.
Resetting the ECS controller at mid to high power settings may cause
uncomfortable cabin pressure surges and ear pain.
Resetting the ECS controller results in the loss of system overtemperature protection for 10 to 70 seconds.
2.13.12.2 AV COOL Switch. The AV COOL switch, located on the lower right instrument panel,
extends the spring−loaded FCS ram air scoop located on the right side of the forward fuselage for
emergency cooling of FCC A, the right TR, and one AHRS unit. The AV COOL switch should be placed
in EMERG if an FCS HOT caution is displayed or during ECS OFF/RAM mode operation as a
preventative measure. Once extended, the FCS emergency ram air scoop cannot be retracted in flight.
EMERG Extends the FCS emergency ram air scoop to provide direct ram air cooling of FCC A,
the right TR, and one AHRS unit, and supplemental cooling to other avionics.
NORM FCS emergency ram air scoop not extended. The switch is spring−loaded to the NORM
position.
2.13.13 LCS - Liquid Cooling System. The LCS is a closed loop system normally used to transfer
heat from the radar transmitter to fuel and/or ambient air. When fuel temperatures are warmer than
the liquid coolant (typically at low fuel levels and high ambient temperatures), the LCS is used to
transfer heat from the fuel to ambient air. The LCS contains a liquid coolant pump, a liquid coolant/air
heat exchanger, and an LCS ground cooling fan (all three located in the left LEX) and two liquid
coolant/fuel heat exchangers, and in LOT 26 and up, two liquid coolant/ECS air heat exchangers.
The LEX liquid coolant/air heat exchanger has one air inlet located on the bottom of the LEX, and
two air exhausts. Only one exhaust path is commanded open at any given time. During LCS ground
cooling fan operation, the exhaust on the bottom of the LEX is commanded open. Inflight, only the air
exhaust on the top of the LEX can be commanded open.
LCS ground cooling fan air is the primary cooling source for liquid coolant on deck. During ground
operations, the liquid coolant pump and LCS ground cooling fan are commanded on when power is
applied to the radar (RADAR knob in STBY, OPR, or EMERG).
During ground operations, when feed tank fuel temperatures exceed 40°C (30°C in LOT 26 and up),
the liquid coolant pump and LCS ground cooling fan may also be commanded on if the RADAR knob
in OFF in order to provide LCS cooling of the fuel system. In LOT 25 and below, the bypass valve,
which allows liquid coolant to the liquid coolant /fuel heat exchangers, is solely controlled by the liquid
coolant temperature, so the amount of fuel cooling provided (if any) depends on the temperature of
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-105 ORIGINAL
each fluid. In LOT 26 and up, the bypass valve is controlled by the ECS controller and will only allow
liquid coolant to the liquid coolant/fuel heat exchanger with the RADAR knob in OFF.
NOTE
In LOT 26 and up, the RADAR knob must be in OFF in order to
provide any postflight LCS fuel cooling.
In either case, placing the RADAR knob to OFF removes the radar as a heat source and should
extend ground operating time.
Inflight, the LCS ground cooling fan secures, the lower air exhaust path closes, and the upper air
exhaust path is controlled by the mission computer. The upper air exhaust path opens when feed tank
fuel temperatures exceed 40°C (30°C in LOT 26 and up), ram air is cooler than fuel, and AOA is below
15°C. In LOT 25 and below, heat not removed by the LEX liquid coolant/air heat exchanger is removed
by the fuel system through the liquid coolant/fuel heat exchangers. In LOT 26 and up, heat not
removed by the LEX liquid coolant/air heat exchanger is removed by a combination of the liquid
coolant/fuel and liquid coolant/ECS air heat exchangers.
In LOT 26 and up, provisions have been incorporated to limit the risk of fire following a major liquid
coolant leak. When LCS low pressure is detected, the liquid coolant pump secures and check valves
limit coolant leakage. Since the SDC controls the liquid coolant pump, an SDC reset secures the pump,
resulting in a radar OVRHT (APG−73) or LOFLOW (APG−79) indication, and the radar stops
transmitting.
NOTE
In LOT 26 and up, an SDC reset temporarily secures the liquid coolant
pump. Before selecting SDC RESET, the RADAR knob should be set
to STBY until the SDC reset is complete and normal radar cooling
capability is restored.
2.13.14 ECS Related Warnings, Cautions, and Advisories. The following ECS related warnings,
cautions, and advisories are described in the Warning/Caution/Advisory Displays in Part V:
D L BLEED and R BLEED warning lights
D BLEED AIR LEFT (RIGHT) voice alert
D AV AIR HOT caution
D L or R BLD OFF cautions

I-2-106 ORIGINAL
2.14 OXYGEN SYSTEMS
2.14.1 On Board Oxygen Generating System (OBOGS). OBOGS provides oxygen rich breathing gas
to the aircrew while either engine is operating. Engine bleed air is cooled and routed through the
OBOGS inlet air shutoff valve to the OBOGS concentrator. The breathing gas is routed from the
concentrator to a cockpit plenum, where the temperature is stabilized and a limited supply is stored for
peak flow demands. From the plenum, the breathing gas flows through the pilot services panel oxygen
disconnect, through the seat survival kit, to the aircrew regulators and masks.
A leak or break in the breathing gas system anywhere from the pilot
services panel oxygen disconnect to the mask will prevent either normal
OBOGS breathing gas or emergency oxygen from being delivered to the
mask in its intended concentration. Leaks and breaks may be difficult to
locate and/or verify. If hypoxic symptoms are experienced or an OBOGS
system degrade occurs, immediate descent below 10,000 feet cabin
altitude is required to prevent severe or incapacitating hypoxia.
The OBOGS concentrator is powered by the left 115 volt ac bus. Two molecular sieve beds in the
OBOGS concentrator remove most of the nitrogen from the engine bleed air. The nitrogen is dumped
overboard while the remaining output of oxygen rich breathing gas is supplied to the aircrew.
2.14.1.1 OBOGS Monitor. The CRU-99/A solid state oxygen monitor is located on the left side of the
seat bulkhead in the front cockpit and is powered by the left 28 volt dc bus. The monitor continuously
measures oxygen concentration in the OBOGS breathing gas and provides a discrete signal to activate
the OBOGS DEGD caution if the oxygen concentration falls below a predetermined level.
Loss of electrical power to the OBOGS monitor prevents reporting of
OBOGS DEGD conditions.
The monitor performs a power-up BIT during a 2 minute warm-up period and conducts a periodic
BIT every 60 seconds. No indication is provided if power-up or periodic BIT pass.
Preflight BIT of the monitor is accomplished by using either the pneumatic BIT plunger or the
electronic BIT pushbutton. Refer to figure 2-33. Pressing up and holding the pneumatic BIT plunger
for 15 to 65 seconds tests the operation of the OBOGS monitor by diverting cabin air into the monitor
to create a low oxygen concentration condition.
After initiating OBOGS pneumatic BIT, failure to ensure plunger is fully
extended may result in contamination of OBOGS plenum which may lead
to hypoxic conditions.
Momentarily pressing and releasing the electronic BIT pushbutton tests the monitor electronically.
Successful completion of either test activates the OBOGS DEGD caution, which clears automatically
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-107 ORIGINAL
after BIT is complete and OBOGS resets to normal operation.
Successful OBOGS monitor BIT is required prior to flight. A BIT failure
indicates that there is no protection against inadequate oxygen concentration or hypoxia due to a degraded OBOGS monitor. Good breathing
gas flow alone does not ensure adequate oxygen concentration.
2.14.1.1.1 OBOGS DEGD Caution. An OBOGS DEGD caution is set by the OBOGS monitor when
oxygen concentration is below a predetermined level. The OBOGS DEGD caution threshold is always
above cabin air conditions, in order to provide a physiological safety margin.
NOTE
Oxygen concentration may drop below the predetermined OBOGS
DEGD level if breathing gas flow is unlimited. Removing the mask
without placing the OXY flow knob to OFF, system leaks, and/or loose
aircrew hose connections can overwhelm system capacity and may
result in an OBOGS DEGD caution.
After a total loss of bleed air, OBOGS breathing gas flow will be available until the residual gas
within the system is depleted. The residual oxygen concentration may be sufficient to keep the OBOGS
Figure 2-33. OBOGS Monitor
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-108 ORIGINAL
DEGD caution from illuminating, but loss of system pressure will ultimately lead to inadequate
pressure and an abrupt inability to breathe.
Low mask flow or increased breathing resistance may occur without an accompanying OBOGS
DEGD caution, which indicates a potential system degradation that may result in oxygen levels below
physiological requirements.
When cabin altitude is above 10,000 feet, OBOGS DEGD caution
procedures shall be executed for low mask flow, increased breathing
resistance, or OBOGS DEGD cautions of any duration.
A single brief appearance of the OBOGS DEGD caution immediately following placing the OBOGS
control switch to ON, turning the OXY FLOW knob to ON, or after donning or removing the mask is
normal. Certain malfunctions affecting the OBOGS system also may momentarily cause OBOGS
DEGD cautions. A momentary OBOGS DEGD caution may clear from the DDI so rapidly that the
aircrew may be unable to determine the cause of the MASTER CAUTION light/tone.
Repeated unexplained MASTER CAUTION lights/tones may be an
indication of OBOGS system degradation.
Even with the OBOGS DEGD caution displayed, OBOGS breathing gas under normal flow is of
higher quality (i.e., oxygen concentration, partial pressure and purity) than cabin air. Once cabin
altitude is below 10,000 feet, aircrew may elect to conserve emergency oxygen by resetting the
emergency oxygen release tab, then either removing the mask and breathing cabin air, or returning the
OXY FLOW knob and the OBOGS control switch to ON and breathing through the mask.
Pure oxygen accelerates recovery from hypoxia. Emergency oxygen shall
be used whenever hypoxic symptoms are recognized.
2.14.1.2 Breathing Regulator. The aircrew torso mounted breathing regulator reduces both normal
and emergency oxygen system operating pressures to breathing pressure levels. The regulator delivers
undiluted OBOGS breathing gas or emergency oxygen to the aircrew at positive pressure, the limits of
which increase automatically with altitude. It interfaces with the hose assembly, which connects with
the seat survival kit oxygen disconnect.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-109 ORIGINAL
2.14.1.3 OBOGS Control Switch. The OBOGS control switch, located on the left console in the front
cockpit, is used to control electrical power to the OBOGS concentrator and the OBOGS inlet air shutoff
valve.
ON Supplies electrical power and engine bleed air to the OBOGS concentrator.
OFF OBOGS system off.
2.14.1.4 OXY FLOW Knob. The OXY FLOW knob, located on the left console in both cockpits, is
used to control the supply of OBOGS breathing gas to each aircrew’s mask.
ON OBOGS flow supplied to the mask.
OFF OBOGS flow secured.
It is possible to place the OXY FLOW knob in an intermediate position between the ON and OFF detents, which may result in a reduced
flow of breathing gas. The OXY FLOW knob should always be fully
rotated to the ON or OFF detent position.
2.14.2 Emergency Oxygen. Emergency gaseous oxygen is contained in a bottle in the seat survival
kit. The bottle is connected into the OBOGS supply hose as it passes through the kit. From this point,
the emergency oxygen and OBOGS breathing gas share a common path to the aircrew mask.
A leak or break in the breathing gas system anywhere from the pilot
services panel oxygen disconnect to the mask will prevent either normal
OBOGS breathing gas or emergency oxygen from being delivered to the
mask in its intended concentration. Leaks and breaks may be difficult to
locate and/or verify. If hypoxic symptoms are experienced or an OBOGS
system degrade occurs, immediate descent below 10,000 feet cabin
altitude is required to prevent severe or incapacitating hypoxia.
A pressure gauge is visible on the inside left front of the survival kit. The bottle provides
approximately 10−20 minutes of oxygen. Oxygen duration decreases with lower altitude.
Under less than optimum conditions (low altitude, heavy breathing,
loose−fitting mask, etc.), as few as 3 minutes of emergency oxygen may be
available.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-110 ORIGINAL
The emergency oxygen supply is activated automatically upon ejection. The emergency oxygen
supply may be activated manually by pulling the emergency oxygen green ring on the outside of the left
thigh. The emergency oxygen supply may be deactivated at aircrew discretion by pushing down on the
release tab immediately forward of the green ring.
With emergency oxygen selected, the OXY FLOW knob(s) shall be
placed to OFF. If not secured, OBOGS system pressure may prevent
emergency oxygen from reaching the breathing regulator. Additionally,
the OBOGS control switch should be placed to OFF to backup the OXY
FLOW knob.
2.15 FIRE DETECTION, FIRE EXTINGUISHING, AND BLEED AIR LEAK DETECTION SYSTEMS
The fire detection system contains dual-loop fire detectors and three FIRE warning lights. The fire
extinguishing system contains a READY/DISCH light and a fire extinguisher bottle. The two systems
provide engine bay, AMAD bay, and APU bay fire warning, engine and APU emergency shutdown, and
selective fire extinguishing capability. The fire extinguisher bottle is located in the aft fuselage
between the engines. The bottle contains a nontoxic gaseous agent which provides a one-shot
extinguishing capability.
Electrical power from the 28 vdc essential bus is required to operate the fire detection and
extinguishing systems. The systems can operate on battery power alone with the BATT switch ON.
A separate dry bay fire suppression (DBFS) system is incorporated to automatically detect and
extinguish a fire or explosion in the dry bays below fuel tanks 2, 3, and 4.
2.15.1 FIRE Lights. Two FIRE warning lights, one for each engine/AMAD bay, are located on the
upper left and right sides of the main instrument panel. The warning lights come on when a fire
condition is detected in the respective engine/AMAD bay. The left FIRE light indicates a fire condition
in the left engine/AMAD bay. The right FIRE light indicates a fire condition in the right engine/
AMAD bay.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-111 ORIGINAL
Each light is a pushbutton, which is guarded to prevent inadvertent actuation. Pushing the left or
right FIRE light arms the fire extinguisher bottle (FIRE EXTGH READY light on) and closes the
corresponding engine feed shutoff valve, the crossfeed valve, and the crosscooling valve.
Because the engine VEN/start pumps are fuel lubricated, pushing a FIRE
light prior to throttle OFF may damage the corresponding pump. To
reduce the likelihood of damage, FIRE lights should only be pressed as
directed by NATOPS (following throttle OFF for actual emergencies or
as specifically delineated for an FCF A profile).
If a FIRE light is pressed, the pushbutton stays in and approximately 1/8 inch of yellow and black
stripes is visible around the outer edges of the light.
2.15.2 APU FIRE Light. The APU FIRE warning light is located on the main instrument panel
inboard of the right FIRE light. The APU FIRE light comes on when a fire condition is detected in the
APU bay. The APU FIRE light is also a pushbutton. Pushing the APU FIRE light arms the fire
extinguisher bottle (FIRE EXTGH READY light on) and secures fuel to the APU. If the APU FIRE
light is depressed, the pushbutton stays in and approximately 1/8 inch of yellow and black stripes is
visible around the outer edges of the light.
2.15.3 FIRE Warning Voice Alerts. When the left, right, and/or APU FIRE lights are illuminated, the
ENGINE FIRE LEFT, ENGINE FIRE RIGHT, or APU FIRE voice alerts, respectively, are also
activated. If more than one FIRE light comes on at the same time, the voice alert priority is LEFT,
RIGHT, then APU.
2.15.3.1 FIRE Warning Lights (F/A-18F). The rear cockpit left, right, and APU FIRE warning lights
are advisory only. These lights are not pushbuttons, and they do not arm the fire extinguisher bottle
or shut down the engines or APU.
2.15.4 FIRE EXTGH READY/DISCH Light. The FIRE EXTGH READY/DISCH light is located on
the MASTER ARM panel on the left side of the main instrument panel. The top half of the light is
yellow and is labeled READY. The bottom half of the light is green and is labeled DISCH. When the
fire extinguisher bottle is armed (left, right, or APU FIRE light pressed), the yellow READY light is
illuminated.
The FIRE EXTGH READY/DISCH light is also a pushbutton. When the READY light is on,
pushing the light discharges the fire extinguisher bottle into the selected engine/AMAD/APU bay(s).
The FIRE EXTGH READY/DISCH light does not latch like the FIRE lights, which means a signal is
sent to discharge the fire extinguisher bottle ONLY when the light is held in the fully pressed position.
When the fire extinguisher bottle has discharged or pressure has been lost, the green DISCH light
comes on. Therefore, it is good practice with an engine/AMAD bay fire to hold the READY/DISCH
light pressed until the green DISCH light comes on. The fire extinguisher bottle should discharge
within 5 seconds.
For an inflight APU fire, discharge of the fire extinguisher bottle is delayed approximately 10
seconds from when the APU FIRE light is pushed. It is not necessary to hold the READY/DISCH light
for those 10 seconds. However, if the DISCH light does not come on 10 seconds after the APU FIRE
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-112 ORIGINAL
and READY/DISCH lights have been pushed, the READY/DISCH light should be pushed and held
until the DISCH light does come on.
If more than one FIRE light is pressed, the fire extinguisher bottle may not discharge and, if it does,
the concentration of the extinguishing agent sent to the selected bays may be insufficient to extinguish
both fires.
2.15.5 APU Fire Extinguishing System. The APU fire extinguishing system is automatically activated with WonW and must be manually activated with WoffW. If an APU fire condition is detected
with WonW, the automatic function secures fuel to the APU, arms the fire extinguisher bottle, and
after 10 seconds discharges the fire bottle. Discharge of the bottle is delayed for 10 seconds to allow the
APU time to spool down before extinguishing agent is introduced.
Manual activation is accomplished by pushing the APU FIRE light and then the FIRE EXTGH
READY light. Like automatic activation, discharge of the bottle is delayed for 10 seconds after the
APU FIRE light is pushed. If an APU FIRE condition is detected with WonW, manual activation
should be performed to backup the automatic system.
Since the fire extinguishing system requires 28 vdc essential bus power,
the fire extinguisher bottle may not be discharged if the BATT switch is
turned off during the 10 second delay time.
2.15.6 Engine/AMAD Fire Extinguishing System. The engine/AMAD fire extinguishing system
must be manually activated. Manual activation is accomplished by lifting the guard and pressing the
corresponding FIRE light and then the FIRE EXTGH READY light. Pushing the FIRE light secures
fuel to the engine at the engine feed shutoff valve and isolates the left and right fuel systems by closing
the crossfeed and crosscooling valves. When the FIRE EXTGH READY light is pushed, the fire
extinguisher bottle is discharged without delay into the corresponding engine/AMAD bay.
Fire testing indicates that the probability of extinguishing a fire and
preventing relights is greatly increased by immediately discharging the
fire extinguisher.
2.15.7 FIRE Detection System Test. Each of the three FIRE warning lights contains four individual
light bulbs. Light bulb integrity can be tested during a LT TEST with ac power applied. If a
malfunction exists in a fire detection loop associated with the APU FIRE light, the APU FIRE voice
alert does not annunciate and none of the four individual bulbs in the light illuminate. If a malfunction
exists in a fire detection loop associated with either FIRE light, the corresponding ENGINE FIRE
LEFT/RIGHT voice alert does not annunciate and only the individual bulb (or bulbs) associated with
the malfunctioning sensor does not come on. Care must be taken to detect bulbs that are not on in the
FIRE lights during the loop test.
A successful test of the FIRE detection system should illuminate all four bulbs in each of the three
FIRE lights and should annunciate the ENGINE FIRE LEFT, ENGINE FIRE RIGHT, and APU
FIRE voice alerts.

2.15.8 Bleed Air Leak Detection (BALD) System. The BALD system is designed to protect the
aircraft from damage resulting from a bleed air leak. The system contains a BALD controller and 11
detector sensing elements routed along the bleed air distribution lines (ducts, valves, and heat
exchangers). If a bleed air leak is detected, the system attempts to isolate the affected ducting by
automatically closing the appropriate bleed air shutoff valve(s). A leak detected upstream of the
secondary bleed air shutoff valve closes only the appropriate primary bleed air shutoff valve. A leak
detected downstream of the secondary bleed air shutoff valve closes all three valves (secondary and
both primaries).
When a leak is detected, the BALD system sends commands directly to the appropriate bleed air
shutoff valves, to the BLEED warning lights, and to the ACI, triggering the BLEED AIR LEFT
(RIGHT) voice alerts. When the bleed air shutoff valve(s) are commanded closed, the appropriate L
and/or R BLD OFF caution is displayed. The L BLEED and/or R BLEED warning lights extinguish
as soon as bleed air is removed from the leaking duct and may not be on long enough to be recognized
by the aircrew.
Automatic functioning of the BALD system may extinguish the L(R)
BLEED warning lights prior to aircrew recognition and may not trigger
the appropriate voice alerts. In this case, cycling the BLEED AIR knob to
remove the L and/or R BLD OFF cautions reintroduces hot bleed air to
the leaking duct. If the sensing element was damaged by the leak,
automatic shutdown and isolation capability may be lost. Extensive
damage and/or fire may result.
The BALD controller also sends a separate command to the SDC which sets an MSP code for the
appropriate sensing element.
A bleed air leak can be verified by MSP codes 953, 954, 955, 956, 957, 958, 959, 960 or 961 (code
determines leak location). An overpressure condition is indicated by MSP code 833 with no bleed air
leak codes.
Sustained high power, high speed operation at low to medium altitude
may result in dual BLEED warnings and loss of OBOGS, cabin pressurization, and g-suit due to secondary bleed air pressure regulator bay
overheat.
2.15.8.1 Bleed Air Leak Detection System Test. The BALD system is tested by the FIRE test switch
in conjunction with the FIRE detection system. Actuation of the FIRE test switch tests the BALD
system sensors and circuitry. The BALD controller turns on the L and R BLEED warning lights,
annunciates the BLEED AIR LEFT/RIGHT voice alerts, and commands the bleed air shutoff valves
closed setting the L and R BLD OFF cautions. The warnings and cautions indicate that the test has
successfully passed.
The L BLEED and R BLEED warning lights go out when the FIRE test switch is released to NORM,
but the L and R BLD OFF cautions remain until the BLEED AIR knob is cycled through OFF to
NORM with ac power applied.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-114 ORIGINAL
2.15.8.2 FIRE Test Switch. The FIRE test switch, located on the forward left console, is used to
initiate a test of the FIRE detection and BALD systems. Operation of the FIRE test switch requires
28 vdc essential bus power. The switch is spring-loaded to the NORM position.
TEST A Initiates a test of loop A of the fire detection and BALD systems.
NORM Provides normal fire and bleed air leak detection.
TEST B Initiates a test of loop B of the fire detection and BALD systems.
A successful test of the FIRE detection and BALD systems should illuminate all four bulbs in the
left, right, and APU FIRE lights, both L BLEED and R BLEED warning lights, and should annunciate
all of the following voice alerts in order: ″ENGINE FIRE LEFT, ENGINE FIRE RIGHT, APU FIRE,
BLEED AIR LEFT, BLEED AIR RIGHT″ (each repeated twice).
The BALD controller is sensitive to the duration of FIRE test switch actuation. If the switch is not
held in the TEST A or TEST B position for at least 2 seconds, the BALD controller may set a false
MSP code. Additionally, the BALD controller requires 3 seconds between TEST A and TEST B to
successfully reset. If the switch does not remain in NORM for at least 3 seconds, the BALD controller
may not successfully initiate the bleed air warnings and may set a false MSP code.
2.15.9 DBFS - Dry Bay Fire Suppression System. An active DBFS system is incorporated in the
center dry bays under fuel tanks 2, 3, and 4 to automatically extinguish any fires or explosions which
are detected in these areas. The system consists of fourteen optical fire detectors, seven extinguishing
units and a control unit. The control unit integrates system operation and performs BIT. If the DBFS
system fails BIT, a BIT advisory appears, and DBFS BIT status indicates DEGD.
The DBFS system is totally automatic and requires no aircrew action. The system is armed and
capable of suppressing a fire/explosion in the dry bays when the LDG GEAR handle is up and at least
one generator is on line. If a fire/explosion is detected, the controller discharges all extinguishers,
flooding all dry bays with an inert gas (BAY DISCH caution set). If a fire condition is still detected
after 3 seconds, a BAY FIRE caution is set to alert the aircrew that the fire was not extinguished. If
the fire condition ceases, the BAY FIRE caution resets. With the LDG GEAR handle down, the system
still gives a fire warning (BAY FIRE caution) but is not capable of extinguishing a dry bay fire.
2.16 ENTRANCE/EGRESS SYSTEMS
2.16.1 Canopy System. The cockpit is enclosed by a clamshell type canopy. The main components
of the canopy system are an electromechanical actuator, which provides powered and manual operation
of the canopy, and a cartridge actuated thruster with associated rocket motors, which provides
emergency jettison. When closed, the canopy is latched in place by three hooks on the bottom of each
side of the canopy frame and two forward indexer pins on the lower leading edge of the canopy frame.
When the canopy is closed, the latch hooks and indexer pins engage fittings along the canopy sill, and
the canopy actuator rotates the canopy actuation link over-center, locking the canopy. A mechanical
brake in the canopy actuator motor provides a redundant lock. An inflatable seal, installed around the
edge of the canopy frame, retains cockpit pressure when the canopy is locked. A rain seal is installed
outboard of the pressure seal to divert rain water away from the cockpit. See figure 2-34.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-115 ORIGINAL
A high voltage (100,000 volt) static electrical charge may build up in flight
and be stored in the canopy. If possible, make sure that ground crew
discharge the static electricity prior to egress. Otherwise, avoid direct
contact with the outside of the windscreen and canopy to prevent
electrical shock.
Taxiing with the canopy at an intermediate position can result in canopy
attach point damage and failure. Do not open or close the canopy with the
aircraft in motion.
2.16.1.1 Canopy Operation. During normal operation, the canopy is electrically actuated using
either the internal CANOPY switch or external canopy switch. The canopy actuator is powered by the
maintenance bus, which is powered directly by the battery in the absence of ac power (BATT switch
ON or OFF). On battery power, at least five open/close cycles should be available. With the canopy
open, the CANOPY switch must be held to lower the canopy to the rails, slide it approximately 1.5
inches forward, and lock it in place. With the canopy closed and locked, selecting OPEN on the
CANOPY switch (WonW) automatically unlocks and opens the canopy to the full up position. The
switch does not have to be held. Whether the canopy is opening or closing, selecting HOLD stops the
canopy at its present position.
If electrical power is not available, the canopy can be manually operated using either an internal or
external crank system. The canopy can be jettisoned using one of the internal CANOPY JETT
handles.
2.16.1.1.1 CANOPY Switch (Internal). The internal CANOPY switch is located beneath the right
canopy sill in the front cockpit. In LOT 26 and up, the rear cockpit CANOPY switch is located on the
lower right portion of the instrument panel. The CANOPY switch is spring loaded to the HOLD
position and is solenoid-held in the OPEN position only with WonW. The solenoid can be overridden
at any time by placing the switch to HOLD. With WoffW, the switch must be held in the OPEN
position to raise the canopy. Opposing position control commands between the front cockpit and rear
cockpit switches result in a fail-safe OPEN command.
OPEN Unlocks and/or raises the canopy.
HOLD Stops the canopy at any point during the open or close cycle.
CLOSE Lowers and, if held, closes and locks the canopy (CANOPY caution out when
closed and locked).
2.16.1.1.2 Canopy Switch (External). The external canopy switch is located inside the external
power receptacle door (door 9) on the left side of the aircraft below the canopy and LEX. The switch
provides electrical operation of the canopy from outside the cockpit. The switch has the same positions
and operates identically to the internal CANOPY switch, except that the OPEN position is not
solenoid held. After AFC 366, the switch is guarded to prevent inadvertant actuation.

2.16.1.1.3 Manual Canopy Handcrank (Internal). The internal manual canopy handcrank is stowed
in a clip beneath the left canopy sill. The canopy can be manually opened or closed by inserting the
handcrank into the crank socket immediately above the stowage clip. Approximately 70 counterclockwise turns are required to fully open the canopy. Clockwise cranking closes the canopy. A cable is
provided to prevent loss of the handle if dropped.
2.16.1.1.4 Manual Canopy Actuation Fitting (External). The external manual canopy actuation
fitting, a 3/8 inch drive socket on the left side of the aircraft below the canopy, is used to manually
operate the canopy. Inserting a 3/8 inch drive tool in the socket and then turning counterclockwise
approximately 35 turns opens the canopy. Turning the drive tool clockwise closes the canopy.
2.16.1.2 Canopy Jettison System. For canopy jettison, a cartridge initiated thruster is utilized to
unlatch the canopy by moving it 1.5 inches rearward, after which two canopy frame mounted rocket
motors fire to rotate the canopy up and aft, clear of the ejection seat path. The thruster, which provides
attachment for the canopy actuator link during normal canopy operation, is activated by pulling the
ejection seat firing handle or internal canopy jettison handle(s) (figure 2-34). The canopy can be
jettisoned closed, open, or in any intermediate position.
2.16.1.2.1 CANOPY JETT Handle. The CANOPY JETT handle is black and yellow striped and is
located on the left inboard canopy sill just aft of the instrument panel in the front cockpit. Pressing the
button on the tip of the handle unlocks the handle. Pulling the handle aft initiates the canopy jettison
sequence. A ‘‘remove before flight’’ pin is used to manually secure the CANOPY JETT handle between
flights.
2.16.1.2.2 CANOPY JETT Handle (F/A-18F). The rear cockpit CANOPY JETT handle is black and
yellow striped and is located on the left console. Pressing the button on the forward tip of the handle
unlocks the handle. Pulling the handle up initiates the canopy jettison sequence. A REMOVE
BEFORE FLIGHT pin is used to manually secure the CANOPY JETT handle between flights.
2.16.2 Boarding Ladder. A five-step boarding ladder (figure 2-35), stowed under the left LEX,
provides access to the cockpit and the top of the aircraft. Ladder extension and retraction can be
accomplished only from outside the cockpit, either manually or by the ladder remote release button
(after AFC 366) or switch (before AFC 366).
The ladder is extended manually by releasing the latch on the stow assist handle on the ladder’s left
rail (allowing it to drop slightly) and while supporting the ladder, rotating the stow assist handle to
vertical (releasing the remaining two mechanical uplocks on the underside of the LEX). The ladder
rotates down to the extended position. The stow assist handle is then secured. The drag brace locks
when extended to its full length to provide longitudinal stability for the ladder. Lateral stability is
provided by the V-shaped side brace attached to the side of the fuselage.
The LEX is narrow and highly sloped. Use caution to avoid loss of
footing.
NOTE
The ladder is not visible from the cockpit.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-118 ORIGINAL
Normal cockpit egress is accomplished by grasping the canopy sill firmly with both hands, leaning
outboard and, using the ladder marking decals as a guide, stepping over the LEX toward the ladder.
The first step is approximately 15 inches below the leading edge of the LEX.
The ladder is stowed by detaching the rigid side brace connection from the fuselage. Pulling the
collar on the drag brace down permits the telescoping drag brace to unlock and compress as the
boarding ladder is rotated up and aft to the stowed position. The latches are manually engaged and
locked by pushing them full up until locked flush with the forward beam. If necessary, the stow assist
handle can be used to assist in stowing the ladder by releasing the handle and pushing the ladder to
the stowed position and pushing the stow assist handle to the closed (stowed) position and releasing it.
With electrical power on the aircraft, a LADDER caution comes on whenever the proximity switch in
the aft portion of the ladder well is not actuated. With the ladder stowed and the 3 latches locked, the
LADDER caution goes out.
The ladder is extended remotely by opening the ground power receptacle door and holding the
ladder remote release switch (lower switch) to the down (DEPLOY) position. The three latches are
opened by a battery powered actuator. The ladder drops to the open position while being restrained
from free falling by a dampening strut (drop time approximately 3 to 4 seconds). All other procedures
for securing the ladder are the same as manual opening.
2.16.2.1 Ladder Remote Release Switch (Before AFC 366). The external ladder remote release
switch is located inside the external power receptacle (door 9) on the left side of the aircraft below the
canopy and LEX. The switch is lever locked and spring loaded to the UP position. Switch positions are:
UP Removes electrical power from the unlock actuators which allows the ladder to lock
when it is manually stowed.
DEPLOY Applies electrical power to the three unlock actuators which unlocks the actuators
so the ladder can free fall. The switch must be pulled out and down and held in
DEPLOY until the actuators are unlocked.
Due to the close proximity of the ladder remote release switch and the
external canopy switch, positive switch identification is required to
prevent inadvertently lowering the canopy and injuring personnel egressing the aircraft.
2.16.2.2 Ladder Remote Release Button (After AFC 366). The guarded external ladder remote
release button is located inside the external power receptacle (door 9) on the left side of the aircraft
below the canopy and LEX. Pressing and holding the button applies electrical power to the three
unlock actuators which unlocks the actuators so the ladder can free fall.
2.16.3 Ejection Seat. The SJU-17 (V)1/A, 2/A, and 9/A, and SJU-17A (V)1/A, 2/A, and 9/A NACES
(Navy Aircrew Common Ejection Seat) are ballistic catapult/rocket systems that provide the pilot with
a quick, safe, and positive means of escape from the aircraft. See Ejection Seat, foldout section, for
ejection seat illustrations. The seat system includes an initiation system which, after jettisoning the
canopy and positioning the occupant for ejection, fires the telescopic seat catapult. Canopy breakers on
the top of the seat give capability of ejecting through the canopy. As the seat departs the aircraft and
the catapult reaches the end of the stroke a rocket motor on the bottom of the seat is fired. The thrust
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-119 ORIGINAL
of the rocket motor sustains the thrust of the catapult to eject the seat to a height sufficient for
parachute deployment even if ejection is initiated at zero speed, zero altitude in a substantially level
attitude.
NOTE
Safe escape is provided for most combinations of aircraft altitude,
speed, attitude, and flight path within the envelope of 0 to 600 KCAS
airspeed and 0 to 50,000 feet.
2.16.3.1 SJU-17(V) 1/A, 2/A, and 9/A, and SJU-17A (V)1/A, 2/A, and 9/A NACES Seat. Timing of
all events after rocket motor initiation is controlled by the electronic sequencer which utilizes altitude,
acceleration, and airspeed information to automatically control drogue and parachute deployment and
seat/man separation throughout the ejection seat’s operational envelope. In the event of partial or total
failure of the electronic sequencer, a 4-second mechanical delay initiates a barostatic release unit which
frees the occupant from the seat and deploys the parachute between 14,000 and 16,000 feet MSL if the
ejection occurred in or above this altitude range. The emergency barostatic release unit operates
immediately after the 4-second delay if the ejection occurred below 14,000 feet MSL. An emergency
restraint release (manual override) system provides a backup in the event of failure of the barostatic
release unit. The seat is stabilized and the forward speed retarded by a drogue chute attached to the
top and bottom of the seat. The parachute deployment rocket is automatically fired to withdraw the
parachute from deployment bag. Full canopy inflation is inhibited until the g forces are sufficiently
reduced to minimize opening shock. There are 5 modes of operation. See figure 2-36 for parameters
that determine the mode of operation and the corresponding parachute deployment and drogue chute
Figure 2-35. Boarding Ladder
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-120 ORIGINAL
release times. At high altitude the drogue chute deploys to decelerate and stabilize the seat. The seat
falls drogue retarded to 18,000 feet MSL where the drogue is released, the main parachute is deployed,
and seat/man separation occurs. At medium altitude, (between 18,000 and 8,000 feet MSL), and at low
altitude (below 8,000 feet MSL) parachute deployment is automatically delayed from 0.45 to 2.90
seconds (depending upon airspeed and altitude) after first seat motion to allow the drogue chute to
decelerate and stabilize the seat.
The main parachute is a 21 foot aeroconical canopy type, stored in a headbox container on top of the
ejection seat. The parachute is steerable and contains water deflation pockets which aid in dumping air
from the canopy after landing in water. The seat drogue chute is stored in a separate container on top
of the drogue deployment catapult. The seat contains controls for adjusting seat height and for locking
and unlocking the inertia reel shoulder restraint straps. A survival kit is installed in the seat pan.

I-2-121 ORIGINAL
2.16.3.2 SEAWARS - SEAWATER Activated Release System. SEAWARS is a seawater activated
system that automatically releases the parachute from the crew member. When the sensing-release
units are immersed in seawater, cartridges are fired which allow the crew member to separate from the
parachute.
2.16.3.3 Ejection Control Handle. The ejection control handle, located between the crewman’s legs
on the front of the seat pan, is the only means by which ejection is initiated. The handle, molded in the
shape of a loop, can be grasped by one or two hands. To initiate ejection, a 20 to 40 pound pull removes
the handle from its housing, and a continued pull of 30 to 60 pounds is required to pull both sears from
the dual initiators. Either of the initiators can fire the seat. After ejection, the handle remains attached
to the seat. The ejection control handle safes the ejection seat safe/armed handle.
2.16.3.4 Ejection Seat SAFE/ARMED Handle. To prevent inadvertant seat ejection, an ejection seat
safe/armed handle is provided. The handle, forward on the right seat armrest, safeties the seat when
rotated up and forward, and arms the seat when it is rotated aft and down. The safe/armed handle is
locked when placed to either of these two positions and the handle must be unlocked by squeezing a
locking lever within the handle cutout before changing positions. When in the armed position the
visible portion of the handle (from the occupant’s vantage point) is colored yellow and black with the
word ARMED showing. In the safe position, the visible portion is colored white with the word SAFE
showing. The seat is safe only when the word SAFE is entirely visible on the inboard side of the
SAFE/ARM handle and the handle is locked in the detent. Placing the handle to the SAFE position
causes a pin to be inserted into the ejection firing mechanism to prevent withdrawal of the sears from
the dual seat initiators.
2.16.3.4.1 CK SEAT Caution. The CK SEAT caution light is located on the caution light panel and
repeats the DDI CHECK SEAT caution. The caution comes on when the right throttle is at MIL or
above, weight is on wheels, and the ejection seat is not armed.
2.16.3.5 Shoulder Harness Inertia Reel. Pilot shoulder harness restraint is provided by a dual strap
shoulder harness inertia reel mounted in the seat below the parachute container. The dual inertia reel
shoulder straps connect to the parachute risers which in turn are buckled to the seat occupant’s upper
harness. The inertia reel locks when the reel senses excessive strap velocity. Manual locking and
unlocking of the reel is controlled by the shoulder harness lock/unlock handle on the left side of the
seat bucket. During ejection a pyrotechnic cartridge is fired to retract the shoulder harness to position
the seat occupant for ejection.
2.16.3.6 Shoulder Harness Lock/Unlock Handle. The shoulder harness lock/unlock handle on the
left side of the seat bucket has two positions. To operate, the handle must be pulled up against spring
pressure, moved to the desired position, and released.
FORWARD
(locked)
The inertia reel prevents the reel straps from being extended and ratchets any
slack in the straps back into the reel.
AFT
(unlocked)
The reel allows the pilot to lean forward, but the inertia portion of the reel continues to protect by locking the reel when it senses excessive strap velocity. Once
locked, the pilot can normally lean forward again after a slight release in pressure
on the reel straps.
2.16.3.7 Leg Restraint System. A leg restraint system is located on the front of the ejection seat. The
function of the system is to secure the occupant’s legs to the seat during ejection. The system consists
of two adjustable leg garters, a restraint line, and a snubber box for each leg. One garter is worn on the
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-122 ORIGINAL
thigh and one on the lower leg. The restraint lines are routed through the garter rings and the snubber
box as shown in figure 2-37. One end of each restraint line is secured to the cockpit floor and the other,
after being routed through the snubber box and both garter rings, is secured to the seat just outboard
of the snubber box by a releaseable pin. During ejection, the slack in each line is taken up and the
tension builds up to finally separate the lines at the tension rings in the leg lines. At man/seat
separation, the pins on the other end of the lines are released by the time release mechanism. The pins
are also released when the manual override handle is pulled. Both the lower garter and thigh garter
contain a quick release buckle which disconnects the ring through which the leg restraint line runs,
permitting the pilot to egress from the aircraft wearing both upper and lower garters. In addition, toe
clips are installed on the tops of the rudder pedals to prevent contact between the toes and the
instrument panel during ejection.
2.16.3.7.1 Leg Restraint Snubber Release Tabs. The leg restraint lines are adjusted to give the pilot
more leg movement by pulling inboard the leg restraint snubber release tabs (figure 2-37) and
simultaneously pulling the leg restraint lines forward through the snubber box.
2.16.3.8 Seat Survival Kit (SKU-10/A). The SKU-10/A survival kit is used with the SJU-17 and
SJU-17A ejection seats. This survival kit, which fits into the seat bucket, is a contoured rigid platform
which contains an emergency oxygen system and a fabric survival rucksack (figure 2-38). A cushion on
top of the platform provides a seat for the aircrew.
The rigid platform forms a hard protective cover to the survival package and oxygen system and is
retained in position in the seat bucket by brackets at the front and lugs secured in the lower harness
locks at the rear. Attached to the lugs are two adjustable lap belts with integral quick release fittings.
A flexible oxygen and communication hose is installed in the left aft side of the upper kit to provide
a connection to the aircrew for aircraft oxygen and communication. An emergency oxygen cylinder,

pressure reducer, and associated pipe work are mounted on the underside of the platform. A green
manual emergency oxygen operating handle is mounted on the left side of the platform and a pressure
gage is on the inside face of the left leg support. The emergency oxygen can be activated manually by
pulling the green emergency oxygen handle upwards. The green emergency oxygen handle can be reset,
shutting off the flow of emergency oxygen, by pushing downward on the button on the front end of the
emergency oxygen handle assembly. The emergency oxygen is automatically activated during ejection
by a lanyard connected between the floor and the survival kit. An AN/URT-33A locator beacon is
located in a cutout in the left leg support. The beacon is actuated during ejection by a lanyard
connected to the emergency oxygen lanyard.
The survival rucksack is retained to the underside of the rigid platform by 5 fabric straps and a
double cone and pin release system. The package accommodates a life raft and survival aids. Two
yellow manual deployment handles are mounted on the aft surface of the kit. Pulling either handle
enables the aircrew to deploy the raft and survival package after man/seat separation. The life raft
inflates automatically on survival package deployment and is attached to the survival package with a
line. If the survival kit must be deployed after water entry, a snatch pull on the red manual activation
handle near the CO2 bottle is required to inflate the life raft.
2.16.3.9 Manual Override Handle. A manual override handle permits releasing the pilot’s lower
harness restraints and the leg restraint lines for emergency egress and permits resuming part of the
ejection sequence (man/seat separation and main parachute deployment) in the event of sequencing
failure during ejection. The manual override handle, on the right side of seat bucket and just aft of the
ejection seat safe/arm handle, is actuated by pressing a thumb button on the forward part of the handle
and rotating the handle up and aft. If the manual override handle is actuated on the ground or in the
air before ejection, survival kit attachment lugs and leg restraint lines are released, the inertia reel is
unlocked, and the ejection seat safe/armed handle automatically rotates to the SAFE position. During
ground emergency egress, after the manual override handle is pulled and the parachute riser fittings
are released, the pilot is free to evacuate the aircraft with the survival kit still attached. If the manual
override handle is actuated after ejection but before man/seat separation occurs, the following events
take place: release of survival kit attachment lugs, negative-g strap (SJU-17 (V)1/A, 2/A, and 9/A only),
leg restraint lines, and inertia reel straps; firing of the manual override initiator cartridge; firing of the
barostatic release unit; and firing of the parachute deployment rocket, which deploys the parachute.
The ejection seat safe/armed handle automatically rotates to the SAFE position whenever the manual
override handle is actuated.
Pulling the manual override handle automatically rotates the ejection
seat safe/armed handle to the SAFE position, releases the survival kit
attachment lugs and leg restraint lines, and unlocks the inertia reel. If
this is done inflight, the aircrew will be unable to eject.
2.16.3.10 Seat Bucket Position Switch. The seat bucket position switch is on the left side of the seat
bucket, forward of the shoulder harness lock/unlock handle. The forward switch position lowers the
seat bucket, the aft position raises the seat bucket. The center off position, to which the switch is spring
loaded, stops the seat bucket. The maximum vertical travel of the seat bucket is 5.1 inches for the
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-125 ORIGINAL
SJU-17 (V)1/A, 2/A, and 9/A, and 6.1 inches for the SJU-17A (V)1/A, 2/A, and 9/A. The actuator
should not be operated over 1 minute during any 8 minute period.
• To prevent increased risk of thigh slap or leg contact injuries, aircrew
with a buttock-to-knee length greater than 25.5 inches should not use
either of the two forward backpad positions. Aircrew with buttock-toknee length between 24.6 and 25.5 inches should not use the full
forward backpad position.
• Actuation of the seat bucket position switch with the leg restraints
under the seat bucket may result in an inadvertent ejection.
Actuation of seat bucket position switch with lap belts, shoulder harness,
and/or leg restraints outside or under seat bucket may damage ejection
seat, leg restraints, and/or Koch fittings.
2.16.3.11 Backpad Adjustment Mechanism (SJU-17A (V)1/A, 2/A, and 9/A). The backpad adjustment mechanism handle is on the seat bucket adjacent to the top left hand side of the backpad and is
connected to the backpad by a linkage. The backpad has three positions, full-forward, middle, and fullaft, which give a total forward/aft adjustment of 1.6 inches. When the handle is in the full-up position,
the backpad is full-aft, and when the handle is full-down, the backpad is full-forward. To move the
backpad, the adjustment handle is moved within a quadrant until a spring-loaded plunger engages in
one of the three detent positions in the quadrant. Set the backpad for personal comfort and best access
to flight controls during initial strap-in and prior to flight.
2.16.4 Ejection Seat System (F/A-18F). The ejection seats in the F/A-18F are ejected at opposite
divergent angles to one another. The rear seat diverges to the left while the forward seat diverges to the
right. The amount of divergence is influenced by the weight of the aircrew and the speed of the ejection.
The heavier the aircrew and the faster the speed the less the resulting divergent angle. In addition, a
sequencing system is installed to allow dual ejection initiated from either cockpit or single (aft) seat
ejection initiated from the rear cockpit. A command selector valve is installed in the rear cockpit to
control whether ejection from the rear cockpit is dual or single.
2.16.4.1 EJECTION MODE Handle (F/A-18F). The EJECTION MODE handle is located on the right
side of the main instrument panel in the rear cockpit. The EJECTION MODE handle is used to select
the desired ejection sequence to be initiated from the rear cockpit, or provide for single ejection for solo
flight. Positioning is accomplished by pulling out while turning to the desired position. The SOLO
position requires the use of a collar to hold the handle in that position. To release from AFT
INITIATE, pull then turn clockwise.

ejection initiation may result in a collision between seats.
• SOLO mode shall be selected when the aircraft is being flown solo.
Alternate selection when flying solo results in ejection of unoccupied
seat and possible collision with the front cockpit seat.
When selecting NORM or SOLO from AFT INITIATE, the handle must
be pulled before rotation or damage to the command selector valve may
result.
2.16.4.2 SEAT CAUT MODE Switch (F/A-18F). The SEAT CAUT MODE switch is located in the
rear cockpit above the command selector valve. The switch position changes the operation of the CK
SEAT caution for solo or dual flight.
NORM CK SEAT caution is activated by either seat remaining safed. Switch is spring
loaded to this position.
SOLO CK SEAT caution is activated only by the front seat remaining safed. Switch must
be pinned to remain in this position.
2.16.4.3 CK SEAT Caution (F/A-18F). The CK SEAT caution light is located on the caution light
panel, and repeats the DDI CHECK SEAT caution display. The caution is displayed when the right
throttle is at MIL or above, weight is on wheels, and the cockpit ejection seat is not armed with the rear
cockpit NORM/SOLO switch set to SOLO or either ejection seat is not armed with the NORM/SOLO
switch set to NORM.
2.17 EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT
2.17.1 Jettison Systems. The jettison systems consist of the emergency jettison system and the
selective jettison system.
2.17.1.1 Emergency Jettison. Emergency jettison is performed by pushing the EMERG JETT
button with either the LDG GEAR handle UP or with WoffW. When activated, the emergency jettison
system jettisons all stores, launchers, and racks from the BRU-32 racks on the six wing pylon stations
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-127 ORIGINAL
(2, 3, 4, 8, 9, and 10) and the centerline station (6). Emergency jettison is sequential by station pairs:
3 and 9, 2 and 10, 4 and 8, then 6. There is a 100 msec, ±25 msec, delay before the first set of stations
is jettisoned and in between each subsequent set.
2.17.1.2 EMERG JETT Button. The EMERG JETT button is located on the left side of the main
instrument panel and is black and yellow striped. The button must be pressed and held during the
entire jettison sequence. The EMERG JETT button is used to initiate emergency jettison with the
LDG GEAR handle UP or with WoffW.
The EMERG JETT button must be pressed for 500 msec to make sure all
stores are jettisoned.
If the EMERG JETT button has been pushed on the ground prior to
takeoff and remains stuck in, emergency jettison is activated as soon as
the aircraft goes WoffW. The only cockpit indication of this condition is
SMS BIT status DEGD and MSP 082 (Emergency Jettison Switch Failed
On).
2.17.1.3 Selective Jettison. Selective jettison is performed using the SELECT JETT knob, in
conjunction with the JETT STATION SELECT buttons, and jettisons stores in a safe condition. The
stores or the launchers/racks (with any attached stores) can be jettisoned from the centerline and wing
stations, and the missiles can be jettisoned from the fuselage stations.
Selective jettison requires ARM conditions satisfied and all the landing gear up and locked. ARM
conditions are satisfied with WoffW, LDG GEAR handle UP, MASTER ARM switch in ARM, and
SIM mode unboxed. ARM status can be confirmed on the STORES page. All the landing gear up and
locked can be confirmed by the absence of the LDG GEAR handle warning light/landing gear warning
tone with the LDG GEAR handle UP.
Selective jettison of the centerline and wing stations requires station(s) selection by the JETT
STATION SELECT buttons and STORES or RACK/LCHR selection by the SELECT JETT knob.
Selective jettison of a fuselage station missile requires R FUS MSL or L FUS MSL selection by the
SELECT JETT knob.
With all the requirements met, selective jettison is performed by pressing the JETT center
pushbutton in the SELECT JETT knob.
2.17.1.3.1 JETT STATION SELECT Buttons. The JETT STATION SELECT buttons are on the left
edge of the instrument panel below the emergency jettison button. The buttons are labeled CTR, LI,
RI, LM, RM, LO and RO. Pressing a button turns on an internal light and selects a weapon station for
jettison. The JETT STATION SELECT buttons are also used in the backup A/G weapon delivery
modes for weapon selection; refer to A1-F/A-18EA-TAC (Series).
2.17.1.3.2 SELECT JETT Knob. The SELECT JETT knob on the left vertical panel has rotary
positions L FUS MSL, SAFE, R FUS MSL, RACK/LCHR, and STORES. L FUS MSL and R FUS
MSL select either fuselage missile for jettison. The RACK/LCHR and STORES positions select what
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-128 ORIGINAL
is to be jettisoned from the weapon station(s) selected by the JETT STATION SELECT buttons. The
JETT center pushbutton activates the jettison circuits provided ARM conditions are satisfied and all
the landing gear are up and locked. The SAFE position prevents any selective jettison.
2.17.1.3.3 AUX REL Switch. The AUX REL switch, on the lower instrument panel, is used to enable
jettison of hung stores or store and rack/launcher combinations from BRU-32 racks on stations 2, 3, 4,
6, 8, 9, and 10. A need to use the AUX REL switch is indicated by a hung indication on the DDI after
a selective jettison or a normal weapons release is attempted. Placing the switch to ENABLE selects
the auxiliary release function. AUX RELEASE has the same requirements as those listed above for
selective jettison. Jettison is initiated by selecting RACK/LCHR or STORES on the selective jettison
knob, selecting the hung store station by pressing the appropriate station jettison select button, and
pressing the JETT center pushbutton of the selective jettison knob. The SMS provides a jettison signal
to fire the auxiliary cartridge in the BRU-32 rack on which the hung store or store and rack/launcher
combination is loaded. After the cartridge is fired, the store or rack/launcher is gravity dropped with
the store in a safe condition. This switch is also used with some weapons for a second normal release
attempt after these weapons have been hung during a first normal release attempt. Refer to
A1-F18EA-TAC-Series for these weapons and procedures.
2.17.2 Warnings/Cautions/Advisories. The warning/caution/advisory system provides visual indications of normal aircraft operation and system malfunctions affecting safe operation of the aircraft.
The lights are on various system instruments and control panels in the cockpit. The red warning lights
normally indicate a systems malfunction that could be a severe hazard to further flight, and may
require immediate action. Caution lights and displays normally, but not always, indicate malfunctions
that require attention but not immediate action. After the malfunction has been corrected, warning
and caution lights and caution displays go out. Advisory lights and displays indicate safe or normal
conditions and supply information for routine purposes. Warning, caution and advisory displays are
NVG compatible. Caution and advisory displays appear on the left or right DDI and the MPCD,
depending on the number of displays in operation. The advisory displays start at the bottom of the
display and are preceded by ADV. The caution displays, in larger characters than the advisory displays,
appear immediately above the advisory displays. The caution lights, located on the caution lights panel
and the instrument panel, are yellow lights. The advisory lights, scattered throughout the cockpit(s),
are green. Lights that have been lit on the caution lights panel flash when overheated to prevent light
damage.
2.17.2.1 MASTER CAUTION Light. A yellow MASTER CAUTION light, on the upper left part of the
instrument panel, comes on when any of the caution lights or caution displays come on. The MASTER
CAUTION light goes out when it is pressed (reset). An audio tone is initiated whenever the MASTER
CAUTION light comes on. The tone is of 0.8 second duration and consists of a 0.25 second sound
followed by a 0.15 second sound of higher pitch, followed by one repetition of these sounds. The tone
does not repeat unless the original condition causing the tone clears and recurs 5 seconds after the first
tone, regardless of whether or not the MASTER CAUTION is reset. Additional cautions sound the
tone, regardless of whether or not the MASTER CAUTION is reset, providing about 5 seconds have
elapsed since the previous caution. Pressing the MASTER CAUTION when it is unlighted causes the
uncorrected caution and advisory displays to reposition to the left and to a lower level, provided there
is available space vacated by corrected caution and advisory displays. To restack the cautions and
advisories when the MASTER CAUTION is lighted, the MASTER CAUTION must be pressed twice:
first, to turn off the MASTER CAUTION light and second, to reposition the caution and advisory
displays. A reset MASTER CAUTION light (and tone) comes on if there is at least one uncorrected
caution present when weight is on the wheels and both throttles are moved beyond approximately 80%
rpm if both throttles were below 80% for at least 60 seconds.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-129 ORIGINAL
2.17.2.2 MASTER CAUTION Light (F/A-18F). A yellow MASTER CAUTION light, on the upper
instrument panel comes on whenever the MASTER CAUTION light in the front cockpit comes on.
The rear cockpit MASTER CAUTION light goes out whenever the front cockpit MASTER CAUTION
is reset.
2.17.2.3 Dimming and Test Functions. There are no provisions for testing the caution and advisory
displays and each DDI contains its own display dimming controls. The warning/caution/advisory lights
are dimmed by the warning/caution lights knob and are tested by the lights test switch. The following
lights can be dimmed by the warning/caution lights knob, but once in the dimmed lighting range
cannot be varied in intensity: MASTER CAUTION light, landing gear handle warning, L BAR
warning, HOOK warning, L BLEED warning, R BLEED warning, APU FIRE warning, left and right
engine FIRE warning.
2.17.3 Voice Alert System. For certain critical warnings and cautions, voice alert transmissions are
sent to the aircrew’s headset. The message is repeated twice; for example, APU FIRE, APU FIRE. The
voice alert requires no reset action on the pilot’s part and the alert is not repeated unless the original
condition ceases for 5 seconds or more and then recurs. For cautions with voice alert, the voice alert
replaces the master caution tone; however, the master caution tone backs up the voice alert system and
provides a tone if the voice alert system malfunctions. FIRE, APU FIRE, L BLEED, and R BLEED
warning lights are not backed up by the master caution tone. Voice alert is the only audio warning for
these problems. With dual generator failure, the following voice alert warnings operate from battery
power: APU FIRE, ENGINE FIRE LEFT (RIGHT), and BLEED AIR LEFT (RIGHT). All voice alert
cautions, and the master caution tone are inoperative on battery power during dual generator failure.
Once a voice alert has been activated, it cannot be interrupted by a higher priority voice alert. All
voice alerts play until completed. The primary radar low altitude warning (WHOOP, WHOOP), is
repeated at the lowest priority until reset or disabled by the pilot. With MC OFP 20X AND UP OR
H3E AND UP, the BINGO voice alert is repeated every 30 seconds until the BINGO setting is
adjusted.
NOTE
With an MC1 failure (LOTs 21-24), the voice alert does not sound
when the aircraft descends below the altitude set by the primary low
altitude warning setting.

2.17.4 Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) (MC OFP 18EA and H2E AND UP). The terrain
awareness warning system alerts the aircrew of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) condition during
all mission phases. The system operates any time that the navigation mission computer (MC1) and
TAMMAC digital mapping set (DMS) are functional. TAWS functions as a safety backup system and
not as a performance aid. TAWS has been designed to eliminate false warnings, minimize nuisance
warnings, and generate consistent aircrew response in all aircraft master modes. Five possible voice
warnings are provided to indicate the correct initial response to an impending CFIT condition, and a
visual cue is provided to indicate the recovery direction of pull, or in some instances, to command an
increase in turn rate. All TAWS warnings should be treated as though an imminent flight into terrain
condition exists. Pilot response to a TAWS warning should be instinctive and immediate.
TAWS uses data from the following inputs: FCC, INS, RADALT, GPS, and digital terrain elevation
data (DTED). DTED resides in the DMS as part of TAMMAC and is used to provide the
forward-prediction capability that protects against flight into rising terrain. The TAWS option is
reached by pressing MENU-HSI-DATA-A/C as shown in figure 2-39. The TAWS option boxes
automatically at start-up.
When a DMS is not installed in the aircraft or is not operational, protection from CFIT events is
provided by the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS). BIT may be initiated on the DMS by
pressing the appropriate pushtile of the BIT display. The BIT can take up to 185 seconds to complete.
During the BIT, TAWS is not operational. Therefore, the GPWS algorithm is used to determine the
presence of possible CFIT events. There is no capability for pilot selection of GPWS if DMS is
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-131 ORIGINAL
operational. The GPWS algorithm runs continuously with outputs being overwritten if TAWS is
operational. This prevents erroneous values during an unexpected transition from TAWS to GPWS.
2.17.4.1 TAWS Modes. TAWS has two operational modes: TAWS-with-DTED, and TAWS- withoutDTED. These modes switch automatically depending upon the available sensor data and flight phase.
When the aircraft position (latitude and longitude) is accurately known and DTED for the local area
has been loaded onto the DMS (during the theater load process), TAWS is in the TAWS-with-DTED
mode and provides protection against varying terrain ahead of the aircraft. When the aircraft position
is not accurately known, DTED for the local area is unavailable, or TAWS determines the aircraft is
in a landing phase, TAWS transitions to the TAWS-without-DTED mode and provides protection
against flight into level or descending terrain as GPWS does.
When operating over the ocean, DTED does not exist and TAWS will be in the TAWS-withoutDTED mode. However, there is no degradation in protection because the ocean is relatively flat. As the
aircraft approaches the coast or islands, DTED may be available (depending upon the theater load)
and TAWS will automatically switch back to the TAWS-with-DTED mode.
Operation of TAWS in the TAWS-without-DTED mode is still an improvement over GPWS as
TAWS incorporates a more robust performance model and additional input sensor redundancy.
2.17.4.2 TAWS Operation. TAWS incorporates signal processing that determines a best estimate of
aircraft position and altitude (AGL and MSL). TAWS protection algorithm continuously computes
two recovery trajectories: Vertical Recovery Trajectory (VRT) and Oblique Recovery Trajectory
(ORT). VRT is the standard GPWS-like recovery: roll to wings-level, if needed, and pull to recover.
Figure 2-39. HSI-DATA-A/C Controls
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-132 ORIGINAL
ORT assumes that you maintain the current bank angle and pull to recover (increase turn rate). Both
computed trajectories include the following assumptions:
a. Pilot Response Time is the time from issuance of a TAWS warning to the time that the pilot
actually initiates recovery. Pilot Response Time is set at 1.3 seconds.
b. Roll Recovery Phase is the time necessary to roll the aircraft to near wings-level. This assumes
at least ½ lateral stick will be used for bank angles less than 70° and at least ¾ lateral stick
will be used for bank angles ≥ 70°.
c. G-Onset Phase is the time required to pull to the target recovery g. The target recovery g is
80% of the instantaneous g available, or 5g, whichever is less. The g-onset phase assumes that
rapid aft stick motion will be used (full deflection within ¾ second). In addition, TAWS
assumes that throttles will be moved to MAX if below corner speed and to IDLE if above
corner speed.
d. Dive Recovery Phase is the remainder of the trajectory until terrain clearance is achieved.
TAWS assumes a terrain clearance of 50 ft.
When TAWS senses that the aircraft is in the landing configuration, the recovery assumptions must
change since the desire is to land. TAWS defines the landing phase as below 500 ft AGL, less than 200
KCAS, landing gear down and locked, and more than one minute since a waveoff or takeoff. In the
landing phase, TAWS protects against landings of greater than the structural limit of the landing gear
(1584 fpm). To allow this, TAWS switches to TAWS-without-DTED and provides a warning when the
landing is predicted to exceed the structural limit of the landing gear.
TAWS provides protection against gear-up landings. When the aircraft is below 200 KCAS, below
150 ft AGL, more than one minute since waveoff or takeoff, and the landing gear is not down and
locked, a TAWS warning is provided.
2.17.4.3 TAWS Warnings. TAWS provides clear, unambiguous, and directive aural and visual cues
to the aircrew. Aural warnings provide the aircrew with a wake-up call and correct initial response
while visual warnings provide the aircrew with correct follow-on recovery information.
2.17.4.3.1 Voice Warnings. TAWS uses the ACI to provide aural cues to the aircrew. The aural cues
are distinct from any other cues that the aircrew may receive. The TAWS voice alert warnings are:
″Roll−Left...Roll−Left″, ″Roll−Right.....Roll−Right″, ″Pull−Up...Pull−Up″, ″Power...Power″, and
″Check Gear″. Each of these warnings is issued at a level 3−6 dB above the present voice alerts. The
TAWS voice warnings provide a wake−up call to the aircrew and indicate the most appropriate initial
response for the given aircraft state, not necessarily the only required response. The aural cue repeats
until the warning condition is cleared. TAWS aural warnings have priority over all current aural tones.
Note that TAWS requires a -1018 or greater ACI load (or MIDS equivalent) which is capable of
generating the ″Roll Left/Right″ warnings. Earlier ACI loads were only capable of generating ″Roll
Out″ warnings and are not desired for use with TAWS.
A ″Roll Right...Roll Right″ warning is issued when a roll to the right is the correct initial response.
A ″Roll Left...Roll Left″ warning is issued when a roll to the left is the correct initial response.
A ″Power...Power″ warning is issued when the roll requirement conditions have not been met and
adding power is the correct initial response. This occurs when the aircraft is below 200 KCAS, the AOA
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-133 ORIGINAL
is above 8.5° for PA configuration (or 18° AOA for up and away configuration) and the throttle is not
already at MAX. The correct response to this warning is to select MAX afterburner.
A ″Pull Up...Pull Up″ warning is issued when the above conditions have not been met and pulling up
is the correct response or when the ORT is the recovery trajectory.
When a warning is given to protect against a gear-up landing, the following aural cues may be heard:
″Pull Up...Pull Up″ followed two seconds later by ″Check Gear″ when the gear handle is in the UP
position and a gear-up landing condition has been assessed (repeated every 4 seconds).
″Check Gear″ repeated every 8 seconds when the gear handle is down and a gear up landing condition
has been assessed.
2.17.4.3.2 Visual Warnings. A visual recovery arrow is provided in the center of the HUD and HUD
format on the DDI. The recovery arrow indicates the direction of recovery. The visual warning is
displayed when a CFIT condition is present and is removed when the CFIT condition is cleared.
TAWS visual recovery cues are designed to be used in conjunction with TAWS voice warnings.
There are several voice warning/visual recovery cue combinations. When the arrow points UP in the
HUD (i.e., along the lift vector), a longitudinal pull is the correct response and an aural ″Pull Up...Pull
Up″ is heard. This is a VRT recovery if the aircraft is close to wings level, or it is an ORT (increased
turn rate) recovery if the aircraft is banked such that the TAWS algorithm assessed that an increased
turn rate would provide the quickest recovery from an impending CFIT condition. Figures 2-40 and
2-41 depict these two situations. Both situations require a longitudinal pull as the correct response,
however, the first case (VRT) depicts a dive recovery while the second case (ORT) depicts a recovery
requiring an increase in turn rate by increasing g when already in an established angle of bank.
When the arrow points anywhere other than UP in the HUD (i.e., not along the lift vector, but
perpendicular to the horizon), it may be accompanied by either a ″Roll Left (Right)″...″Roll Left
(Right)″ or ″Pull Up...Pull Up″ voice warning. The voice warning indicates the correct initial response,
then the aircrew should roll or pull as required to place or maintain the TAWS recovery arrow straight
up in the HUD (i.e., along the lift vector). For example, if a ″Roll Left...Roll Left″ voice warning is
issued with an accompanying HUD recovery arrow displayed in the HUD that is perpendicular to the
Figure 2-40. TAWS HUD Visual Recovery Warning - Pull Up (VRT)
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-134 ORIGINAL
horizon, the correct response is to roll left to align the lift vector with the HUD recovery arrow and then
perform a dive recovery. If a ″Pull Up...Pull Up″ voice warning is issued with an accompanying HUD
recovery arrow displayed in the HUD that is perpendicular to the horizon, the correct response is to
apply g along the current lift vector and then, referencing the HUD recovery arrow, roll to align the lift
vector with the HUD recovery arrow and perform a dive recovery. Figure 2-41 depicts a situation in
which a Roll or Pull Up aural warning could be issued. If a ″Roll Right...Roll Right″ aural warning was
issued, a roll to the right would be the correct initial response and then a dive recovery would be
continued with a longitudinal pull. If a ″Pull Up...Pull Up″ aural warning was issued, a longitudinal pull
would be the correct initial response and then a roll to the right to align the lift vector with the HUD
recovery arrow followed by a longitudinal pull for a dive recovery would be the follow-on recovery
procedure.
2.17.4.4 ACI Configuration Check. There are different ACI configurations in the F/A-18 aircraft.
Two TAWS software loads exist: -1016 and -1018. The -1016 ACIs can command these four aural cues:
″Roll Out...Roll Out″, ″Pull Up...Pull Up″, ″Check Gear″, and ″Power...Power″. The -1018 and greater
ACIs added logic for replacing the ″Roll Out...Roll Out″ aural cue with ″Roll Left...Roll Left″ and ″Roll
Right...Roll Right″. Due to the variety of possible combinations, on cold start power-up, the MC
commands a ″Roll Left...Roll Left″ to the ACI to determine if it is in the -1018 configuration. If there
is no response, the MC commands a ″Roll Out...Roll Out″ to the ACI to determine if the ACI is in the
-1016 configuration. If no response is received the second time the MC attempts to command a ″Roll
Out...Roll Out″, the TAWS/GPWS voice warnings will not be heard, however the visual arrow will still
be present when a warning is issued.
2.17.5 GPWS - Ground Proximity Warning System. GPWS is designed to backup the pilot by
providing an alert of impending controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). GPWS provides warnings of
potentially unsafe maneuvering flight conditions such as excessive bank angles, excessive sink rates,
gear up landings, floor altitude violations, and altitude loss during recovery. The system is operational
as long as MC1, radar altimeter, and air data systems are ON and functional. The GPWS algorithm
operates in the background of the OFP with no cockpit indications until an actual CFIT warning is
required. The system provides distinctive aural and visual warning cues only, to alert and direct
recovery from an impending CFIT condition. The pilot maintains full control of the aircraft for
recovery.

2.17.5.1 GPWS Sensors/Modes. GPWS is a look-down system with no forward-looking capability.
GPWS uses the radar altimeter as the primary source of terrain clearance information and the FCC air
data function, GPS, and INS as backup altitude sources when radar altitude is invalid. Radar altitude
is considered invalid by GPWS above 4,950 feet AGL or at a pitch or angle of bank greater than 50°.
With valid radar altitude data, GPWS calculates terrain slope from inputs from the INS and the radar
altimeter. Over descending terrain, GPWS assumes the terrain descends indefinitely (until the system
senses a change in terrain slope). This mechanization allows for maximum protection while minimizing
nuisance warnings.
For the first 5 seconds after radar altitude becomes invalid (as indicated by a flashing ″B″ in the
HUD or RALT Xd out on the UFCD), GPWS provides no CFIT protection. After 5 seconds, the system
enters ″COAST″ mode for a period of up to 2 minutes. While in COAST mode, GPWS calculates an
estimate of the aircraft current height above terrain. COAST mode can only be enabled while the
aircraft is not transonic and was over flat terrain (defined as slope less than 2°). CFIT warnings can still
be generated while in COAST mode. If the aircraft was transonic or was not over flat terrain when
radar altitude data was lost, GPWS transitions into the BYPASS mode. In the BYPASS mode, no
CFIT warnings are generated. Full protection is resumed from both modes when valid radar altitude
data is restored.
2.17.5.2 Altitude Required For Recovery Calculations. GPWS calculations for altitude required for
recovery include the loss of altitude due to persistency timers, pilot reaction time, time to roll wings
level, target g-onset rate, and steady state dive recovery time. GPWS pilot reaction time varies
depending on flight conditions but is a minimum of 0.5 second in the GPWS LAT envelope (±30° AOB,
0 to 30° dive, 450 to 560 KCAS). Pilot reaction time is reduced in the GPWS LAT envelope, where pilot
situational awareness is typically good, in order to reduce false warnings. Time to roll wings level is
based on a ½ to ¾ lateral stick displacement roll at 1g. Target g-onset rate is 80% of the available
g-onset rate up to (1) 5g/sec (less than 400 KCAS or greater than 30° AOB) or (2) 6g/sec (greater than
400 KCAS and less than 30° AOB). Steady state dive recovery time is based on a target sustained-g of
80% of g-available up to (1) 5g (less than 400 KCAS or greater than 30° AOB) or (2) 6g (greater than
Figure 2-42. TAWS HUD Visual Recovery Warning (VRT)
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-136 ORIGINAL
400 KCAS and less than 30° AOB). Regardless of which category applies, these g-onset
rates and sustained-g levels require an aggressive pilot response.
2.17.5.3 CFIT Protection Provided.
Above 150 feet AGL -
Above 150 feet AGL, GPWS continuously calculates the altitude required to recover. A CFIT
warning is issued if the altitude required to recover plus a variable safety buffer and an added terrain
clearance altitude is greater than the current altitude above terrain. The terrain clearance altitude
varies between 30, 50, and 90 feet, depending on flight conditions.
Below 150 feet AGL -
Below 150 feet AGL, GPWS transitions to provide warnings of CFIT conditions related to takeoff
and landing. These warnings are based on (1) the time since a WoffW transition (takeoff or T&G) or
a waveoff and then (2) a combination of landing gear position, airspeed, altitude, and sink rate. GPWS
defines a waveoff as 1000 fpm rate of climb for more than 5 seconds while below both 500 feet AGL and
200 KCAS. If the following sets of conditions are valid for greater than 0.3 seconds when the aircraft
altitude is less than 150 feet, a CFIT warning is provided. The CFIT warning is cancelled when the
condition no longer exists for 0.3 seconds.
1. Less than 60 seconds after WoffW or a waveoff:
a. Floor Altitude - less than 90 feet AGL and greater than 250 KCAS.
b. Takeoff Sink Rate - less than 150 feet AGL, less than 250 KCAS, greater than 300 fpm sink.
2. More than 60 seconds after WoffW or a waveoff:
a. Floor Altitude - less than 90 feet AGL and greater than 200 KCAS.
b. Check Gear - less than 150 feet AGL, less than 200 KCAS, descending, and landing gear not
down.
c. Landing Sink Rate - less than 150 feet AGL, less than 200 KCAS, landing gear down, and an
excessive sink rate. The allowable sink schedule varies from a maximum of 2,040 fpm to a
minimum of 1,488 fpm based on altitude and GW.
d. Bank Angle - less than 150 feet AGL, less than 200 KCAS, greater than 45° AOB for one
second.
Below 150 feet AGL, GPWS does not directly account for the recovery
capabilities of the aircraft. Therefore, recovery may not be possible
following a warning under extreme flight conditions.
2.17.5.4 GPWS Warning Cues. GPWS provides distinctive, clear, unambiguous and directive visual
and aural cues to the aircrew for each potential CFIT condition.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-137 ORIGINAL
2.17.5.4.1 GPWS HUD Recovery Arrow. The GPWS visual warning cue is a steady arrow located in
the center of the HUD. See figure 2-43. The HUD recovery arrow is always perpendicular to the horizon
and points in the direction of pull required for recovery. The HUD recovery cue is displayed
simultaneously with all voice warnings except CHECK GEAR. The HUD recovery arrow remains
displayed until GPWS calculates that a CFIT condition no longer exists.
2.17.5.4.2 GPWS Voice Commands. Refer to figure 2-44 for GPWS aural warning cues.
Voice commands automatically transition to the appropriate command for the current stage of
recovery (e.g., ROLL OUT transitions to PULL UP when AOB becomes less than 45°). The voice
commands are terminated when the appropriate recovery maneuver is initiated (e.g., a PULL UP is
initiated within 0.5 g of the GPWS calculated target-g).
• In addition to following the voice commands, additional pilot action
may be required to avoid an unrecoverable situation (e.g., aft stick
with a POWER call or power addition/subtraction with a PULL UP
call.)
• GPWS voice alerts are delayed if other voice alerts are currently being
transmitted.

2.17.5.5 Areas of Limited CFIT Protection. Areas where CFIT protection is considered limited are
as follows:
1. In the COAST mode (5 to 120 seconds outside the valid RALT envelope).
2. Over rising terrain of greater than 2° slope (GPWS is inhibited to prevent nuisance warnings).
3. Within the GPWS LAT envelope where allowable pilot reaction times have been reduced (±30°
AOB, 0 to 30° dive, 450 to 560 KCAS).
4. Below 150 feet AGL in the landing phase (less than 200 KCAS) where warnings are designed only
to prevent hard landings.
At certain high speed, high gross weight conditions, overriding the
g-limiter may be required for recovery from dives greater than 50° and
will likely be required for dives between 10 and 25°.

2.17.5.6 Areas of No CFIT Protection. Areas of no protection are as follows:
1. Loss of air data or RALT, INS, or MC1 failed or off (non-AMCD aircraft), or either MC1 or MC2
failed or off (AMCD aircraft).
2. Less than 6 seconds after WonW.
3. Less than 5 seconds or greater than 120 seconds outside the valid RALT envelope.
4. Transonic flight (0.95 to Mach 1.04) outside the valid RALT envelope.
5. For 1.5 seconds after a break X is displayed.
6. After a waveoff until exceeding 1,000 fpm for 5 seconds.
7. Dives greater than 50° after 2 minutes above 5,000 feet AGL.
2.18 INSTRUMENTS
Refer to foldout section for cockpit instrument panel illustration. For instruments that are an
integral part of an aircraft system, refer to that system description in this section.
2.18.1 Standby Attitude Reference Indicator. The standby attitude reference indicator is a selfcontained electrically driven gyro-horizon type instrument. It is normally powered by the right 115
volts ac bus. If this power fails it is automatically powered by an inverter operating off the essential 28
volts dc bus. An OFF flag appears if both power sources fail or the gyro is caged. During caging the gyro
initially cages to 4° pitch and 0° roll regardless of aircraft attitude. After 3 to 5 minutes, the indicator
reads 0° pitch and 0° roll. Power should be applied for at least 1 minute before caging. The indicator
displays roll through 360°. Pitch display is limited by mechanical stops at approximately 90° climb and
80° dive. As the aircraft reaches either stop, the gyro tumbles 180° in roll. A needle and ball are at the
bottom of the instrument. A one needle width turn is 90° per minute.
2.18.2 Standby Airspeed Indicator. The standby airspeed indicator displays airspeed from 60 to 850
KIAS. It operates directly from left pitot and static pressure.
2.18.3 Standby Altimeter. The standby altimeter is a counter-pointer type. The counter drum
indicates altitude in thousands of feet from 00 to 99. The long pointer indicates altitude in 50-foot
increments with one full revolution each 1,000 feet. A knob and window permit setting the altimeter
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-140 ORIGINAL
to the desired barometric setting. This setting is also used by the flight control computers. The standby
altimeter operates directly from left static pressure.
2.18.4 Standby Rate of Climb Indicator. The standby rate of climb indicator displays vertical speed
on a scale from 0 to ±6,000 fpm and operates directly from left static pressure.
2.18.5 Standby Magnetic Compass. A conventional aircraft magnetic compass is mounted on the
right windshield arch in the front cockpit and in the rear cockpit in Lots 21 thru 25.
2.18.6 Angle Of Attack Indexer. The angle of attack indexer is mounted to the left of the HUD. It
displays approach angle of attack (AOA) with lighted symbols; corresponding AOA indications are
shown on the HUD (see figure 2-45). The indexer operates with the landing gear down and locked and
weight off the gear. The lighted symbol(s) flash if the arresting hook is up and the hook bypass switch,
on the left vertical panel, is in CARRIER. The symbols will not flash with the arresting hook up and
the hook bypass switch in FIELD. The switch is solenoid held to FIELD and automatically goes to
CARRIER when the arresting hook is lowered or aircraft power is removed. The AOA indexer knob on
the HUD controls dimming of the symbols. All symbols light when the lights test switch on the interior
lights control panel is held to TEST.

2.19 AVIONICS SUBSYSTEM
The avionics subsystem combines the integration and automation needed for operability with the
redundancy required to ensure flight safety and mission success. Key features of the system include
highly integrated controls and displays, inertial navigation set with carrier alignment capability, and
extensive built in test capability. The avionics subsystems operate under the control of two mission
computers with primary data transfer between the mission computers and the other avionics
equipment via the mux buses.
2.19.1 Mission Computer System. The mission computer system consists of two digital computers
(MC1 and MC2) which are high speed, stored program, programmable, general purpose computers
with core memory. Computer de-selection is made with the MC switch on the MC/HYD ISOL panel.
With non-AMCD aircraft, the two mission computers interconnect with the primary avionics
equipment on the avionics multiplex (mux) buses. MC1, referred to as the navigation computer,
performs processing for navigation, control/display management, aircraft built in test (BIT), status
monitoring operations and backup for MC2. MC2, referred to as the weapon delivery computer,
performs processing for air-to-air combat, air-to-ground attack, and tactical control/display.
There are six avionics mux bus channels with redundant paths (X and Y) for each channel.
The mission computer:
1. Computes and controls the data sent to the cockpit displays,
2. Computes missile launch and weapon release commands,
3. Provides mode control and options for various avionics systems,
4. Generates BIT initiate signals to and equipment operational status from various avionics
systems.
With AMCD aircraft, the front and rear DDIs are driven directly by the MC over a high speed
interface bus, not by avionics mux bus commands. The HUD is driven directly by redundant
connection to either MC. MC1 drives the front and rear LDDIs and HUD while MC2 drives the front
and rear RDDIs and HUD. When an MC is off or non-functional, the displays driven by that MC show
a green square in the center of the display. Each MC provides the same level of functionality in the
single MC backup mode of operation.
On AMCD aircraft, with both MCs inoperative and the left generator operative, the SDC provides
a limited HUD format on the front MPCD/UFCD, prevents the FADEC and ECS controller from going
into default mode operation, and provides left/right ATS cautions when necessary. See Chapter 25
Backup/Degraded Operations for a description of SDC Backup Mode.
AMCD II mission computers are used on aircraft with the aft cockpit 8 x 10 display installed. The
8 x 10 display receives its primary signal through MC2, and is inoperative with computers prior to
AMCDII. The AMCD II computer provides digital video color capability to the 8 x 10 display via the
Fiber Channel Network Switch (FCNS) and High Speed Video Network (HSVN).
The computers receive inputs for navigational data and steering command computations from the
inertial navigation system, electronic flight control system, multipurpose display group, TACAN, and
backup attitude and the navigation system. The computers control display symbology and information
presented to the pilot by the multipurpose display group.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-142 ORIGINAL
2.19.1.1 MC Switch. The MC switch, located on the outboard edge of the aft left console, is used to
manually turn OFF either of the two mission computers, MC1 or MC2.
1 OFF Removes power to MC1.
NORM Both MC1 and MC2 are powered with ac electrical power available.
2 OFF Removes power to MC2.
On non-AMCD aircraft with WonW, both engines will spool up from ground idle to flight idle, if
power is removed from MC1 (MC1 switch in 1 OFF).
2.19.1.2 Mission Data Entry. Mission data (date and flight number) can be manually loaded into the
mission computer for data recorder documentation. Data is entered by performing the following:
1. On the DDI - Press MENU, MUMI, then ID.
2. On the UFCD - Enter Julian Date (DATE).
3. On the UFCD - Enter Flight Information (FLT).
Mission data can be manually loaded into the mission computer through the Memory Unit Mission
Initialization (MUMI) display or automatically loaded into the mission computer through the Data
Storage Set (DSS). The DSS consists of the Memory Unit (MU) and the Memory Unit Mount (MUM)
and provides memory storage for aircraft parameters, maintenance data, and avionics initialization
data. The DSS receives, stores, retrieves, and transmits data with the mission computer.
2.19.1.2.1 Mission Initialization. The MU provides the capability to load the following mission
initialization files: HARM, RADAR, MU ID, TACAN, WYPT/OAP, Combined Interrogator Transponder (CIT), Sequential Steering (S/S), data link/ID, Overlay Controlled Stores (OCS), bomb wind
data, and ALR-67 display resets. The S/S file can have a 15 point sequence consisting of Geographic
Reference Points (GEOREF), GPS waypoints, and almanac data initialization files. Loading is done at
aircraft power up or when MUX communication is lost for more than 1 second and regained. If MUX
communication is not regained, a MU LOAD caution is displayed and an AV MUX error message is
displayed on the MUMI display. Manual loading may be done using the MUMI display.
2.19.1.2.2 MUMI - Memory Unit Mission Initialization Format. The MUMI format (see figure 2-46)
is accessible from the SUPT MENU and with WonW provides a visual indication of mission
initialization files loaded from the MU. If the MU directory indicates that no user files are present, the
MU ID displays NO IDENT. When the MU directory indicates a user file is present, MC1 displays the
option. When the option is selected and the file is being read by MC1, the option is boxed. If the read
is successful, the file is loaded and the option is unboxed. When a file is present and errors have
resulted from reading the file, the following occurs:
1. The MU ID displays NO IDENT.
2. The applicable load error is displayed (HARM, RDR, TCN, WYPT, S/S, OCS, GPS WYPT, GPS
ALM, ALR 67, WIND, DL13, or CIT).
3. MC1 sends the appropriate maintenance code to the SDC.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-143 ORIGINAL
4. If WonW, an MU LOAD caution is displayed on the DDI.
2.19.1.2.3 CRYPTO Switch. Setting the intercommunications amplifier control CRYPTO switch to
the ZERO position sends an erase signal to the MU. This causes the MU to erase all data stored
between predetermined memory locations.
2.19.1.2.4 Erase and Hold Data. The erase controller (EC) within MC1 provides the capability to
automatically or manually erase, or inhibit erasing, of classified data contained in the MU, SMS, MC1,
and MC2.
NOTE
With AMCD aircraft, during an ERASE, the DDI controlled by the
MC undergoing the erase will flash STANDBY, then briefly display a
green square, then flash STANDBY until the erase is complete.
When the EC determines classified mission initialization files have been read from the MU, the EC
classified data management system is activated. When activated, MC1:
Figure 2-46. MUMI Display
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-144 ORIGINAL
1. Displays the HOLD and ERASE options on the MUMI display.
2. Displays the CDATA advisory.
3. Sends applicable maintenance code(s) to the SDC.
2.19.1.2.5 Automatic Erase. The MU, SMS, MC1, and MC2 automatically erase classified data
when all of the following criteria are met.
1. Airspeed is less than 80 KCAS.
2. Left and right engine THA less than 29°.
3. Transition from WoffW to WonW.
4. Pilot does not select erase inhibit (HOLD) or MC SUSPEND options.
NOTE
Automatic erase can be inhibited by selecting the HOLD pushbutton
option.
5. HOLD boxed with MU displayed prevents automatic erase of the MU.
6. HOLD boxed with ALL displayed prevents automatic erase of all units (MU, armament
computer, MC1, and MC2).
The EC commands the MU and the armament computer, then MC1 and MC2 to erase. The MC
ERASE IN XX SEC countdown timer starts (60 seconds). During the countdown, an MC SUSPEND
pushbutton option is displayed. The MC SUSPEND option may be toggled between boxed (selected)
and unboxed (deselected). When the timer reaches zero and the MU and armament computer have
finished erasing, the decision to continue erasing the remainder of MC1 and MC2 depends on the MC
SUSPEND option being deselected (unboxed); when deselected, the remaining erase of MC2 and MC1
is completed.
NOTE
With AMCD aircraft, during an ERASE, the DDI controlled by the
MC undergoing the erase will flash STANDBY, then briefly display a
green square, then flash STANDBY until the erase is complete.
Automatic erase is also initiated by pilot ejection. The state of the HOLD options is ignored during
pilot ejection.
2.19.1.2.6 Manual Erase. Manual erase is a two pushbutton process and is initiated by pressing the
ERASE pushbutton on the MUMI display. When the ERASE pushbutton is pressed, the option to
proceed with the erasure (ERASE) and the option to cancel the erase (CNX) replaces the HOLD and
ERASE options. Selecting the second ERASE option initiates erasure. While erase is in progress,
ERASE is boxed and erasing proceeds the same as automatic erase. When erasing is complete, the
ERASE pushbutton unboxes. While erase is in progress one of the following is displayed on the MUMI
display:
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-145 ORIGINAL
1. ERASING - erasing of unit is in progress.
2. COMPLETE - erasing of unit is complete.
3. FAILED - unit failed to erase.
NOTE
With AMCD aircraft, during an ERASE, the DDI controlled by the
MC undergoing the erase will flash STANDBY, then briefly display a
green square, then flash STANDBY until the erase is complete.
When erase fails, the MC1 retains the MUMI ERASE and HOLD pushbutton options and displays
the ERASE FAIL caution on the DDI. When erasing is complete, MC1 removes the ERASE, HOLD,
and MC SUSPEND pushbutton options from the MUMI display, removes the CDATA advisory from
the display, and resets the applicable maintenance code(s).
2.19.1.2.7 Backup Erase Controller. If MC1 fails, backup erase capability is provided by MC2 by
providing an ERASE option on the HSI format. When the ERASE pushbutton is depressed, the option
to proceed with the erasure (ERASE) and the option to cancel the erasure (CNX) are provided.
Selecting the second ERASE option initiates erasure. While ERASE is in progress, the ERASE option
is boxed; however, additional cuing is not provided. In backup mode, pilot ejection is the only
automatic erase provided. With AMCD aircraft, the MUMI display for the MC being erased disappears
while the erase is in progress.
2.19.2 Master Modes. There are three master modes of operation: navigation (NAV), air-to-air
(A/A), and air-to-ground (A/G). Controls, displays, and the avionics equipment operation are tailored
as a function of the master mode selected. The navigation master mode is entered automatically when
power is applied to the aircraft, when the air-to-air or air-to-ground modes are deselected, when the
landing gear is lowered, when the SPIN mode activates, or when the aircraft has WonW and the THA
is greater than 27°. The A/A master mode is entered either by pressing the A/A master mode button
alongside the left DDI or by selecting an A/A weapon with the A/A weapon select switch on the control
stick. The A/G master mode is selected by pressing the A/G master mode button. The selection is
performed by the stores management set (SMS), and the SMS identifies the selected master mode to
the mission computer.
2.19.2.1 Steering Information. The sources of steering information available in the NAV master
mode are waypoint, TACAN, instrument landing system, and data link. The data link modes available
in the NAV master mode are vector and automatic carrier landing. TACAN and waypoint steering are
mutually exclusive; selecting one automatically deselects the other. Data link, ILS, and TACAN (or
waypoint) steering can be provided simultaneously. The ACL mode is selectable only in the NAV
master mode and the vector mode is available in all master modes. Steering information is used by the
Automatic Flight Control System to provide coupled steering options.
2.19.3 Cockpit Controls and Displays. The cockpit controls and displays which are used for
navigation operation are on the multipurpose display group.
2.19.4 Multipurpose Display Group. The multipurpose display group consists of the right and left
digital display indicators (DDIs), the multipurpose color display (MPCD), 8 x 10 display, the digital
map set (DMS), the head-up display (HUD), the CRS (course) set switch, the up front control display
(UFCD) and the HDG/TK (heading/ground track) set switch. The multipurpose display group
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-146 ORIGINAL
presents navigation, attack, and aircraft attitude displays to the pilot. The multipurpose display group
converts information received from the mission computer system to symbology for display on the DDIs,
the MPCD, the UFCD, and the HUD. The HUD camera records the outside world and HUD
symbology. The left and right DDIs, 8 x 10 display and the MPCD contain pushbuttons for display
selection and selection of various equipment operating modes. The UFCD is an active matrix liquid
crystal display with an infrared (IR) touchscreen for operator inputs. Refer to Part VII for the
operation of each component.
2.19.4.1 CRS Set Switch. The course set switch, located on the main instrument panel on the video
record panel, manually sets the desired course on the HSI display.
2.19.4.2 HDG/TK Set Switch. The heading/ground track set switch located on the main instrument
panel on the video record panel, manually sets the heading marker on the desired heading/ground track
on the HSI display.
2.19.4.3 DDIs. The left and right DDI (LDDI/RDDI) are physically and functionally interchangeable, giving the ability to display desired information on either indicator. With non-AMCD aircraft, the
DDIs also provide symbology to the HUD. The left indicator is used primarily for stores status, built
in test status, engine monitor, caution, and advisory displays. The right indicator is normally used for
radar and weapon video displays.
(Non-AMCD aircraft) The DDIs are NVG compatible and display three colors (red, yellow, and
green) for stroke information. A monochrome version of the digital map can be selected on the left DDI.
Either DDI can provide raster generation for the HUD.
NOTE
It is possible that a transient condition may cause the displays to
blank or provide an erroneous display on the left or right DDI, or
HUD. The problem may be cleared by manually cycling the power to
the left or right DDI.
(AMCD Aircraft) The DDIs have full color capability in all display modes and are NVG compatible.
2.19.4.3.1 Brightness Selector Knob - Non-AMCD Aircraft. Placing this rotary knob to OFF
prevents the DDI from operating. Placing the knob to NIGHT provides a lower brightness control
range and no automatic contrast control. Turning the knob to DAY provides a higher brightness
control range.
2.19.4.3.2 BRT Control Knob - Non-AMCD Aircraft. This knob varies the intensity of the DDI
presentation.
2.19.4.3.3 Brightness Knob - AMCD Aircraft. Placing this rotary knob to OFF prevents the DDI
from operating. When turned on, rotating the knob clockwise increases display brightness, while
rotating the knob counterclockwise decreases display brightness.
2.19.4.3.4 GAIN Control - AMCD Aircraft. This three-position rocker switch affects the existing
gray-scale, shifting the background brightness up or down, with no impact on displayed symbology.
The center position is off, while the up arrow increases background brightness and the down arrow
decreases background brightness. The up and down arrows have momentary and scroll functionality,
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-147 ORIGINAL
depending on how long they are held. Current values are temporarily displayed when switches are
pressed.
2.19.4.3.5 CONT Control. This knob (non-AMCD aircraft), or three-position rocker switch (AMCD
aircraft), varies the contrast between symbology and the dark background on any level of brightness.
With AMCD aircraft, when the contrast rocker is pressed, a graphical and numeric representation of
the current setting is momentarily displayed on the DDI.
2.19.4.3.6 DDI Pushbuttons. There are 20 pushbuttons on each DDI which are used to select the
function and the mode for proper indicator display.
2.19.4.3.7 MENU Formats. There are two MENU formats (figure 2-47), TAC (tactical) and SUPT
(support) through which display selections can be made. The two menu formats can appear on either
the DDI, the UFCD, 8 x 10 display or MPCD.
The TAC MENU is indicated by the word TAC appearing just above the MENU option. The TAC
MENU is selected by actuating the MENU option on any format other than the TAC MENU format.
The SUPT MENU is indicated by the word SUPT appearing just above the MENU option. The SUPT
MENU is selected by actuating the MENU option on the TAC MENU. With MC OFP H2E AND UP,
the current time of day, consisting of two minute digits and two second digits appear in place of the
MENU legend (cold start default). Time of day is also turned on/off with the TISM option on the
Engine Format. MENU pushbutton functionality is unchanged.
The TAC MENU allows selection of the following formats: AZ/EL, HUD, RDR ATTK, STORES,
FLIR, NFLIR, DL13, HARM, A/G WPN, JSOW, SA, IMAGE, CAS, EW, and TGT DATA. The SUPT
MENU allows selection of the following formats: ADI, HSI, HMD, NETS, GPS, MIDS, ROE/IFF
PROG, BIT, CTT, MUMI, CHKLST, ENG, FCS, UFC BU, FPAS, and FUEL.
Some of the options on the MENU formats are conditional and are not always displayed. NFLR,
FLIR, LST, and CAM are listed only if the equipment is communicating with the mission computer.
HARM DSPLY is displayed when HARM is on board and CLC communicating. A/G missile display
(WEDL DSPLY, MAV DSPLY, etc.) is displayed when the MC has determined from the armament
control processor set that a weapon station has been selected which contains one of these weapons.
In Non-AMCD Aircraft, if the navigation computer (MC1) is not on, only HSI is displayed on the
SUPT menu. If the weapon delivery computer (MC2) is not on, the SUPT menu remains unchanged
and the TAC menu does not display the STORES, FLIR/LST/CAM or NFLR, AWW-13, HARM, or
A/G displays. If both mission computers are off or not communicating with the display, the DDI,
MPCD, and UFCD display only a flashing STANDBY in the center of the screen.
In AMCD Aircraft, if either mission computer is off or failed (MC Backup Mode), the options
available on the displays are the same regardless of which computer is failed. MC1 is no longer referred
to as the navigation computer and MC2 is no longer referred to as the weapons computer. If MC1 is
failed or not communicating, the left DDIs in both cockpits will either flash STANDBY or have a green
square present in the middle of the displays. If MC2 is failed or not communicating with the display,
the right DDIs in both cockpits will either flash STANDBY or have a green square present in the
middle of the displays. The 8 x 10 display will not be capable of displaying format symbology or video.
The following options are available in MC Backup mode: HUD, EW, FCS, MIDS, MUMI, ENG, UFC
BU, FUEL, ADI, and HSI. If A/A master mode is selected, the RDR ATTK, SA, and AZ/EL formats
are available as well. No A/G displays are supported in MC Backup mode. If both mission computers
are off or failed, a backup HUD format (driven by the SDC) is displayed on the UFCD and MPCD in
the front cockpit.

2.19.4.3.8 Electronic Attitude Display Indicator (EADI). The electronic attitude display indicator is
available for display on the left or right DDI as an alternative to the attitude display on the HUD
(figure 2-48). The EADI display is selected by selecting the ADI option on the SUPT MENU. The pitch
ladder is displayed in 10° increments. A small circle is displayed on the ball to represent the zenith and
a circle with an inscribed cross is displayed to represent the nadir. A turn indicator which displays FCS
yaw rate is provided below the ball. A standard rate turn (3°/second) is indicated when the lower box
is displaced so that it is under one of the end boxes.
Selecting the INS or STBY options at the bottom of the display determines the source of attitude
information used to generate the display. Upon power-up with WonW, the EADI attitude initializes to
STBY (STBY boxed), thus using the standby attitude reference indicator for attitude source
information. Selecting the INS option (INS boxed) uses attitude information provided by the INS.
Selection of INS or STBY on the EADI does not change the source of attitude data for the HUD.
Airspeed and altitude are displayed in boxes at the top left and right. Altitude source is displayed
to the right of the altitude box and the vertical velocity is displayed above the altitude box. When ILS
is selected the deviation needles are displayed in reference to the waterline symbol. The ILS needles
are yellow when COLOR is selected on the Attack display.
2.19.4.3.9 Shaped Attitude Display Indicator. When the ADI option is selected on the SUPT menu,
a shaped attitude display indicator is available on the MPCD, UFCD, or DDI and 8 x 10 display
(AMCD aircraft). The pitch ladder is displayed in 10° increments, with ±30° in pitch being displayed
when the gear is up. With the gear down, the pitch ladder is displayed in 5° increments with ±15° in
pitch being displayed. A turn indicator is provided below the ball. A standard rate turn (3°/second) is
indicated when the lower box is displaced so that it is under one of the end boxes.
On the MPCD and 8 x 10 display, the shaped ADI is black above the horizon to represent sky, and
green below the horizon to represent the ground. On the UFCD, the shaped ADI is unshaded above the
horizon (sky) and shaded green below the horizon (ground).

Airspeed and altitude are displayed in boxes at the top, altitude source is displayed to the right of
the altitude box and vertical velocity is displayed above the altitude box. When ILS is selected the
deviation needles are displayed in reference to the waterline symbol. The ILS needles are yellow when
COLOR is selected on the attack display.
2.19.4.4 MPCD - Multipurpose Color Display. The MPCD is an NVG compatible digital display
capable of providing any MENU selectable format except the video on the A/G radar display (figure
2-50). The MPCD drives itself using information received on the MUX.
The BRT knob controls the overall video and symbology brightness and also acts as the power
control for the MPCD and UFCD; a detented OFF position at the extreme counterclockwise position.
The CONT knob adjusts the video contrast of the MPCD display. The day/night mode is controlled
by the day/night/NVG switch on the interior lights panel.
2.19.4.4.1 Standby Indication. A flashing STANDBY indication is provided in the center of the
display on initial power-up and when there is invalid mux communication with the MC. If the
STANDBY condition persists for a few seconds, cycling power to the MPCD may return the MPCD
and UFCD to normal operation.
2.19.4.4.2 Brightness and Contrast Controls. The brightness control is used to adjust the overall
brightness of the MPCD display surface, allowing symbology and video to be adjusted. The full
counterclockwise position of the brightness control knob shuts off power to both the MPCD and the
UFCD. Selecting ON powers both the MPCD and the UFCD.
The contrast control is used to adjust video contrast.
2.19.4.4.3 Symbology Rocker Switch. The symbology (SYM) brightness rocker switch is used to
adjust the brightness of the symbology without affecting the brightness of the MPCD video.
Figure 2-48. Electronic Attitude Display Indicator
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-150 ORIGINAL
Symbology change feedback in provided in the left center of the display by a digit from 0 to 9. This
feedback is provided while the rocker switch is pressed and for 5 seconds after the rocker switch is
released.
2.19.4.4.4 DDI Formats on MPCD. Every display format is available on the L or R DDI. A/G radar
symbology and monochrome video is available on the MPCD. A/G video is not available.
2.19.4.4.5 MPCD Formats. With non-AMCD aircraft, if two different map formats are provided in
the front and rear cockpits, only one displays the map; the other provides only symbology. The priority
of the format which displays the map is HSI, followed by SA.
With AMCD aircraft, if two different formats are requesting MAP video underlay, only one displays
the video underlay; the other provides only symbology. MAP video display priority is determined by
two things: 1) which display surface is requesting the MAP underlay and 2) which format is requesting
the MAP underlay. Highest display surface priority is given to the MPCD followed by the DDIs. The
SA format is given the highest priority, followed by the HSI format, for formats requesting the MAP
underlay. Once the MAP is displayed for any format, (SA, HSI), any display surface with that same
format selected will also have the MAP underlay displayed. The MAP underlay is only supported on
the SA or HSI formats.
2.19.4.4.5A 8 x 10 Display. On aircraft LOT 26 AND UP, the 8 x 10 display replaces the aft MPCD.
The 8 x 10 display has a full color Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Display surface and 30 pushbuttons
used for operator inputs. Only 20 buttons are functional, and they duplicate the MPCD/DDI menu
layouts. The top row outboard buttons and top four buttons on each side are not used. The brightness
control switch adjusts the video brightness. The full counterclockwise position, a detented OFF
position, removes power from the 8 x 10 display and the aft cockpit UFCD. Two rocker switches
provide Gain and Contrast control. A numeric value displayed near the switches is used to adjust the
gain and/or contrast to a desired level. Pushbuttons are backlit, controlled by the INST PNL knob on
the aft cockpit interior lights panel. The following formats and related sublevel formats are available:
TAC Menu, SUPT Menu, HSI, EW, SA, TFLIR and BIT. Figure 2-49 shows symbology placement and
map coverage for the 8 x 10 display. See figure FO - 4, foldout section for aft cockpit arrangement with
the 8 x 10 display installed.
The 8 x 10 display is connected directly to MC2. The computer recognizes whether an 8 x 10 display
or an MPCD is installed and uses the corresponding software that matches the configuration at
startup. This affects the UFCD controls and functions in addition to the 8 x 10 display. When MC2 is
offline or during initialization, the 8 x 10 display does not show a format or process bezel inputs. A
flashing STANDBY indication is provided in the center of the 8 x 10 display when MC2 is not
communicating properly with the 8 x 10 display. A standby display pattern (approximately a 1- by
1-inch green square) is present when the Image Transfer Bus (ITB) has lost symbology, video, or a
combination, and the selected format is affected. When interface between MC2 and 8 x 10 display is
lost, only symbology is displayed (via ITB). There is no pushbutton feedback, video control, or BIT
reporting when interface is degraded. The day/night mode of the 8 x 10 display (and rear UFCD) is set
via the DAY/NITE/NVG switch on the forward cockpit interior lights panel through MC2.
In the Situational Awareness (SA) format, the cursor (captains bars) may be slewed over the entire
8 x 10 display surface. Because this area is larger than the DDIs/MPCD, if another display is showing
the same format and the cursor on the 8 x 10 display is slewed beyond the center area, the cursor on
the DDI/MPCD is limited. When this happens, the cursor on the DDI/MPCD displays flashes
continuously. When a SA format has DC priority assigned, the initial cursor position is determined by
the cockpit that initiates the slewing action.

2.19.4.5 HSI Display Symbology. Basic HSI symbology such as the compass rose, ground track
pointer, lubber line (for magnetic heading), true airspeed readout, ADF bearing pointer, groundspeed
readout, and aircraft symbol are not described. These symbols are shown in figure 2-50.
Display format lines, just below the top row of pushbutton labels, indicate the formats being
displayed on the left, center, right and UFCD displays in both the cockpit (left side of HSI display) and
rear cockpit (right side of HSI display).
Radar target and GEOREF symbols are described in A1-F18EA-TAC-Series. The following
paragraphs describe unique navigation symbology. Refer to part VII for a description of how these
symbols are integrated with the navigation system:
1. Waypoint/OAP data. Data for the current steer to waypoint/OAP is displayed on the upper right
corner of the HSI. Waypoint/OAP data consists of bearing, range, and TTG (time-to-go) up to
8:59:59 based on distance and ground speed. When a waypoint/OAP or offset to the OAP is
designated (becomes a target), this data relates to the target. When a waypoint is a waypoint that
was transferred from the GPS, an ID code is displayed under the waypoint data.
2. TACAN data. TACAN data is displayed on the upper left corner of the HSI. TACAN data
consists of bearing, range (slant range), TTG (based on distance and present ground speed), and the
station identifier.
3. Waypoint/OAP symbology. Waypoint/OAP symbology consists of a waypoint/OAP symbol and a
bearing pointer and tail. The waypoint/OAP symbol indicates the position of the selected
waypoint/OAP relative to the aircraft symbol. The waypoint/OAP bearing pointer and tail are
displayed inside the compass rose and indicate bearing to the selected waypoint/OAP. Waypoint/
OAP symbology is displayed whether or not waypoint/OAP steering is selected. When the selected
waypoint/OAP is outside the HSI range scale, the waypoint/OAP symbol does not appear, but the
bearing pointer and tail appears. When a waypoint/OAP is designated, the waypoint/OAP symbol
and circle inside the pointer change to a diamond shape. The offset symbol appears when steering
is to an OAP. The offset symbol indicates the position of the offset relative to the OAP.
4. TACAN symbology. TACAN symbology consists of a TACAN symbol, and TACAN bearing
pointer and tail. The TACAN symbol indicates the position of the TACAN station relative to the
aircraft symbol. The TACAN bearing pointer and tail are located outside of the compass rose and
indicate bearing to the TACAN station. When the TACAN station is outside the HSI range scale, the
TACAN symbol does not appear but the bearing pointer and tail appear. When TACAN range
becomes invalid the TACAN symbol is not displayed.
NOTE
TACAN symbology displayed inside of the compass rose is filtered to
prevent excessive movement of TACAN symbols due to RF
interference. However, the ″fly−to″ needle displayed in the HUD with
TACAN steering selected is not filtered and represents the raw data
received by the TACAN. As a result, for brief periods of time, the
HUD and HSI may display conflicting information regarding aircraft
position with respect to the selected TACAN course line. Aircrew
should use HUD displayed TACAN information when conducting
TACAN approaches.

I-2-154 ORIGINAL
5. Heading select/ground select marker and readout. The heading select/ground select marker is
maneuvered along the periphery of the compass rose using the HDG/TK switch. The digital readout
of the selected heading is located on the lower left corner of the HSI. The heading select/ground
select marker and digital readout are part of the heading select/ground track select mode of the
autopilot.
Course line arrow and readout. The course line arrow indicates the selected course to the
waypoint/OAP or TACAN station. The course is selected using the CRS switch. The digital readout
of the selected course is displayed on the lower right corner of the HSI. The course line arrow is not
displayed when TACAN range is invalid.
6. TDC assignment symbol. The TDC assignment diamond is displayed on the upper right corner
of the HSI. This symbol indicates that the TDC is assigned to the HSI. The TDC assignment
diamond indicates control is assigned to both cockpits. Other symbols indicate cockpit (d) or rear
cockpit (e) TDC control and SLEW control. SLEW is done by actuating the sensor control switch
AFT while in the NAV or A/G master mode. The word SLEW is displayed in the TDC assignment
diamond position when the SLEW option is active.
7. Coupled steering symbology. CPL and the source of the steering information is displayed on
either side of the aircraft symbol in the center of the HSI display whenever the flight control system
is coupled in azimuth to a steering source. Steering source can be WYPT, TCN, or SEQ#. The couple
cue flashes for 10 seconds and is removed if the steering signal is lost or becomes invalid.
8. Sequential steering lines. The sequential steering lines are displayed when a sequence is entered
and when one of the sequence options (SEQ1, SEQ2, SEQ3, or SEQL) is boxed. The sequential
steering lines are available for display in all HSI modes and range scales. Sequential steering lines
are not displayed at power up with WonW and are removed when: magnetic heading is invalid,
aircraft position is invalid, or map slew is selected.
9. Time of day. Zulu time of day (ZTOD) or local time of day (LTOD) are displayed on the lower left
corner of the HSI. For aircraft that pass the FIRAMS real time clock power up BIT, ZTOD does not
need to be entered. For aircraft that do not pass the FIRAMS real time clock power up BIT, ZTOD
must be entered.
10. Groundspeed required. Groundspeed required appears below the current groundspeed readout.
Groundspeed required indicates the groundspeed required to a target based on entered ZTOD, time
on target (TOT), and the target.
11. Elapsed time (ET)/countdown (CD) time. ET and CD time are displayed on the lower right
corner of the HSI, however, only one of the timers can be displayed at a time. ET or CD timer must
be selected to be displayed. ET initializes to zero minutes and seconds and CD time initializes to six
minutes and zero seconds.
12. Aircraft heading. Aircraft heading is indicated on the compass rose. Aircraft heading and bearing
data can be selected as either magnetic or true. With true heading selected, the letter T appears
below the lubber line and the word TRUE appears below the selected scale readout. There is no
indication when magnetic heading is selected.

2.19.4.6 HUD - Head-Up Display. The HUD is on the center main instrument panel. The HUD is
used as the primary flight instrument, weapon status, and weapon delivery display for the aircraft
under all conditions. (Non-AMCD aircraft) The HUD receives attack, navigation, situation, and
steering control information from the left or right DDI symbol generators (under mission computer
control) and projects symbology on the combining glass for head-up viewing. (AMCD aircraft) The
HUD receives all symbology from MC1 or MC2. The HUD is electrically interfaced with the UFCD.
The HUD has NVG compatible raster display capability to allow it to display NFLR video. The
controls for the HUD are below the UFCD and are described in the following paragraphs. See figure
2-51.
2.19.4.6.1 HUD Symbology Reject Switch. The HUD reject switch is located on the HUD control
panel on the center main instrument panel. This switch is used to control the amount of symbology
displayed on the HUD.
NORM Displays full HUD symbology.
REJ 1 Removes the Mach, g, and peak-g indications, the bank angle scale and pointer, the airspeed and altitude boxes, energy caret (landing gear down), and the ground speed
required cue.
REJ 2 Removes REJ 1 symbology and the heading scale, current heading caret, command
heading marker, NAV/TCN range, and the ET, CD, LTOD or ZTOD timer.
2.19.4.6.2 HUD Symbology BRT Control Knob. This knob is used to turn on the HUD and then
varies the display intensity.
2.19.4.6.3 HUD Symbology Brightness Selector Switch. This is a two-position toggle switch with
positions of DAY and NIGHT. Placing the switch to DAY provides maximum symbol brightness in
conjunction with the HUD symbology brightness control. With the switch set to NIGHT, a reduced
symbol brightness is provided in conjunction with the HUD symbology brightness control.
2.19.4.6.4 Black Level Control Knob. The black level control knob, located on the HUD control
panel, adjusts the NFLR video plus or minus ½ a shade of gray per increment when rotated.
Figure 2-51. HUD Controls
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-156 ORIGINAL
2.19.4.6.5 HUD Video Control Switch. The video control switch, located on the HUD control panel,
enables NFLR video display on the HUD with selectable polarity (white hot/black hot).
W/B Selects white hot/black hot polarity.
VID Displays NFLR video in the HUD, if available.
OFF NFLR video off.
2.19.4.6.6 BAL Control Knob. The balance control, located on the HUD control panel, adjusts the
stroke brightness relative to the raster brightness. Rotating the switch from 12 o’clock towards the VID
position holds the brightness of the video (as set by the brightness control switch) and reduces the
brightness of the stroke symbology. The opposite is true when rotating the switch toward the SYM
position.
2.19.4.6.7 AOA Indexer Control Knob. This knob controls the brightness of the indexer lights.
2.19.4.6.8 ALT Selector Switch. The ALT selector switch, located on the HUD control panel, is used
to select the primary altitude source for display on the HUD and for use in the mission computer
(weapon systems calculations).
BARO Selects barometric altitude.
RDR Selects radar altitude.
2.19.4.6.9 ATT Selector Switch. The ATT selector switch, located on the HUD control panel, is used
to select the primary attitude source used for display in the HUD and in MC and FCC computations.
INS Functions identically to the AUTO position.
AUTO Selects filtered INS data as the primary attitude source. The INS automatically reverts
to gyro mode, using unfiltered data if its processor fails. The MC automatically selects
the standby attitude reference indicator for attitude information if the INS fails completely.
STBY Selects the standby attitude reference indicator. The FCCs no longer use INS data and
the HIAOA advisory is displayed.
2.19.4.6.10 HUD Symbology. The following paragraphs describe HUD symbology as related to basic
navigation, steering (direct, great circle, courseline, and ILS), navigation target designation, advisories
and landing, see figure 2-52. Refer to part VII for a description of how these symbols are integrated into
the navigation system. Also, refer to section VII for unique ACL data link symbology. Refer to
A1-F18EA-TAC-Series, for symbology concerning the A/A and A/G master modes, weapons, RWR and
the data link vector mode.
1. Heading. The aircraft magnetic/true heading is indicated by the moving 30° heading scale. The
actual aircraft heading is directly above the caret/T symbol. The moving heading scale provides
trend information during turns. As the aircraft turns right, the scale moves from right to left.
Magnetic or true heading may be selected. Magnetic heading is indicated by a caret below the
heading scale. True heading selection is indicated by a T appearing below the current heading.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-157 ORIGINAL
2. Airspeed. Calibrated airspeed from the FCC is provided in the box on the left side of the HUD.
The tops of the airspeed and altitude boxes are positioned at the aircraft waterline, which is 4° up
from the optical center of the HUD.
HUD airspeed should normally read less than 50 knots while sitting still
on the ground. A reading of more than 50 knots on the ground may
indicate an Air Data failure.
3. Altitude. The altitude presented in the box on the right side of the HUD may be either barometric
altitude or radar altitude depending on the setting of the altitude switch on the HUD control panel.
When the altitude switch is in the BARO position, barometric altitude is displayed. When the
altitude switch is in the RDR position, radar altitude is displayed and is identified by an R next to
the altitude. If the radar altitude is invalid, barometric altitude is displayed and a B next to the
altitude flashes to indicate that barometric altitude is being displayed rather than radar altitude. An
X displayed next to the barometric altitude indicates that the altitude value may be inaccurate. The
ten thousand and thousand digits are 150% size numbers. The hundred, ten, and unit digits are
120% size numbers, except that below 1,000 feet they are 150% size.
4. Barometric setting. The barometric setting used by the air data function in the FCC is the value
set in the standby altimeter. When the barometer setting is changed on the standby altimeter, the
barometric setting is presented below the altitude on the HUD to provide a head-up baro-set
capability. The display remains for 5 seconds after the change is made. In addition, the baro-set
value is displayed and flashed for 5 seconds when the aircraft descends below 10,000 feet at an
airspeed less than 300 KCAS.
5. Angle of Attack. True angle of attack in degrees is displayed at the left center of the HUD. AOA
values displayed on the HUD are filtered and may slightly lag actual true AOA. Therefore, it may
be possible to trigger the AOA tone slightly prior to seeing the applicable limit AOA in the HUD.
The HUD AOA is generally driven by the FCS using the AOA probes. However, around 42° AOA
(and -9°), the HUD reverts to an MC-computed AOA based on INS data and winds. The HUD AOA
flashes indicating that the displayed HUD AOA may be inaccurate because the INS computed winds
have not been updated in the past three minutes. Low AOA, small bank angles, and small rates are
required to update the wind. With MC OFP H3E AND UP, the pitch trim AOA value is displayed
next to the ATC HUD advisory location while trimming and for two seconds after trimming with
WoffW and flaps HALF or FULL. The value is displayed with or without ATC engaged but is not
displayed with autopilot engaged.
6. Mach number. The aircraft Mach number is displayed immediately below the angle of attack.
7. Aircraft g. Normal acceleration of the aircraft is displayed immediately below the Mach number.
8. Peak aircraft g. A peak positive g indication is displayed on the HUD below the normal g when
a threshold of 4.0g is exceeded. The peak positive g display can be removed by cycling the clutter
reject switch to one of the reject positions.

9. Bank angle scale. A bank angle scale and pointer are displayed at the bottom of the HUD for bank
angle reference up to 45°. At bank angles in excess of 47°, the bank angle scale pointer is limited at
45° and flashes.
10. Velocity vector. The velocity vector provides an outside world reference with regard to actual
aircraft flight path. The velocity vector represents the point towards which the aircraft is flying
(aircraft flight path). With a functioning INS, the velocity vector is driven by INS attitude and
velocities. If GPS data is valid, a ″hybrid″ GPS vertical velocity correction is used to correct errors
in the INS vertical velocity loop regardless of the INS mode switch position (CV, GND, NAV, or
IFA). If GPS data is not available for use in the hybrid correction, a VVEL advisory is displayed.
Figure 2-52. HUD Symbology (Sheet 2 of 2)
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-160 ORIGINAL
With a VVEL advisory displayed, sustained climbs and descents, such as
penetration from the marshal stack, can result in uncued (no cautions)
vertical velocity errors and a possible inaccurate velocity vector position.
Error magnitudes increase at slower airspeeds and lower altitudes. Errors
of up to 3° (actual flightpath 3° below the displayed velocity vector) have
been observed in the landing configuration. Three minutes of level flight
may be required to allow the INS to correct the vertical velocity errors.
NOTE
The VVEL advisory will be displayed if a GPS is not installed or if
masking prevents GPS positioning of a sufficient quality to ″aid″ the
INS vertical velocity loop.
The position of the velocity vector is limited to an 8° radius circle centered at the HUD optical
center. If the velocity vector reaches this limit during high angle of attack flight or large yaw and/or
drift angles, it flashes rapidly to indicate that it does not accurately indicate flight path (velocity vector
is HUD limited).
With GPS operating, if the INS velocity data becomes unreliable, the mission computer utilizes GPS
information. If INS velocity data becomes unreliable the mission computer utilizes FCC air data
function information and the last available wind data to compute the velocity vector and this degraded
velocity vector is indicated by a slow flashing of the symbol. In the NAV master mode, the velocity
vector may be caged to the vertical center line of the HUD by the cage/uncage switch on the throttle.
When it is caged, a ghost velocity vector is displayed at the true velocity vector position if that position
is more than 2° from the caged position. The flight path/pitch ladder and steering information are
referenced to the caged position. The ghost velocity vector flashes when limited. The flight path/pitch
ladder is referenced to the waterline symbol when the velocity vector is caged.
The velocity vector is automatically fixed at the horizon with WonW and ground speed less than 80
knots, and its status cannot be changed until WoffW. However, the velocity vector’s selected
caged/uncaged status does not change during touch-and-go landings if the ground speed remains above
80 knots.
11. Flight path/pitch ladder. The vertical flight path angle of the aircraft is indicated by the position
of the velocity vector on the flight path/pitch ladder. The horizon and flight path/pitch angle lines
represent the horizon and each 5° of angle between ±90°. Positive pitch lines are solid and are above
the horizon line. Negative pitch lines are dashed and are below the horizon line. The outer segments
of the lines point toward the horizon. Each line is numbered and the numbers rotate with the lines
so that inverted flight can easily be determined. To aid in determining flight path angle when it is
changing rapidly, the pitch lines are angled toward the horizon at an angle half that of the flight path
angle. For example, the 50° pitch line is angled 25° toward the horizon. In level flight, the pitch lines
are not angled. The zenith is indicated by a circle and the nadir is indicated by a circle with an X
in it. Aircraft pitch angle can be determined by comparing the tops of the altitude and airspeed
boxes (which represent the aircraft waterline) with the pitch ladder when the wings are level, but the
flight path/pitch ladder normally rotates about the velocity vector and determination of pitch angle
may be difficult at high roll angles.

12. Vertical velocity readout. This value is displayed above the altitude box and indicates vertical
velocity in feet per minute. This is displayed in the NAV master mode only. Descent is indicated by
a minus sign.
13. HUD landing symbology. When any two landing gear are down, the Mach number, g, and peak
g are deleted and an AOA bracket, extended horizon bar, waterline symbol, and energy caret appear.
The center of the AOA bracket represents the optimum approach AOA. The bracket moves lower
with respect to the velocity vector as AOA increases and moves higher as AOA decreases. When the
energy state of the aircraft is in equilibrium, the energy caret points to the ″right wing″ of the
velocity vector and the aircraft neither accelerates or decelerates. With an energy deficit, the energy
caret moves lower with respect to the velocity vector and the aircraft decelerates; with excess energy,
the energy caret moves higher and the aircraft accelerates.
14. Waypoint/OAP, mark point, TACAN, or target data. Waypoint/OAP and mark data consists of
range (horizontal), and the steer-to point identifier (W, O, or M) and number located on the lower
right corner of the HUD. TACAN data consists of slant range and a Morse code identifier located
on the lower right corner of the HUD. When a steer-to point is designated, range remains displayed
and the steer-to point identifier changes to TGT.
15. Coupled steering symbology. While coupled steering is engaged CPL SEQ#, CPL WYPT, CPL
TCN, CPL BNK, CPL ASL, CPL HDG, or CPL P/R appears on the right side of the HUD display
above the navigation data.
16. ILS symbology. When ILS steering is selected, an azimuth deviation bar (localizer) and elevation
deviation bar (glideslope) appear on the HUD.
17. ZTOD, LTOD, ET, and CD time. The ZTOD, LTOD, ET, or CD time is displayed on the lower
left corner of the HUD. These timers are mutually exclusive. Only one timer is available for display
on the HUD at a time. When the FIRAMS real time clock power up BIT passes, ZTOD does not need
to be entered, but when the FIRAMS real time clock power up BIT does not pass, ZTOD must be
entered. ET initializes to zero minutes and seconds. CD initializes to 6 minutes and zero seconds.
18. Command heading marker. When waypoint/OAP or TACAN direct great circle steering is
selected, the command heading marker is displayed just below the heading scale.
19. Steering arrow and dots. When waypoint/OAP or TACAN course line steering is selected, the
steering arrow and dots appear on the HUD.
20. Required ground speed cue. When steering is engaged to the target in a sequence, the required
ground speed cue appears under the airspeed box.
21. Target designation symbology. When a target is designated, a target designation symbol
(diamond) appears below the heading scale indicating target heading. Another target designation
symbol (diamond) appears indicating the target line of sight (LOS).
2.19.4.6.11 HUD Symbology Degrades. The avionics suite has built in redundancy with two mission
computers for data management and two DDIs (LOTs 21-24), or two MCs (LOTs 25 and up), for
symbol generation. Likewise, if the attitude select switch is in the AUTO or INS position, back up data
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-162 ORIGINAL
sources are automatically selected to provide HUD symbology when failures are detected. Refer to
figure 2-53, for the HUD displays discussed below.
a. HUD Symbology Degrades with INS Failure. When a failure occurs in the INS, HUD
bank angle, velocity vector, pitch ladder, and heading indications can be expected to be
impacted. With GPS operating, the mission computer utilizes GPS information for the velocity
vector. If INS attitude is valid but INS velocities are not valid the mission computer
automatically uses the INS attitude and GPS velocities to position a non-flashing velocity
vector. With a degradation of the air data function (probe or pressure transmitter set damage
or failure) calibrated airspeed, barometric altitude, indicated Mach number, and vertical
velocity indications may be impacted.
When the INS experiences a total shutdown (dump) with the attitude select switch in AUTO
or INS, or if the attitude switch is deliberately placed in standby, a stationary waterline symbol
replaces the velocity vector indicating that the standby attitude reference indicator is now
providing attitude data. This failure is normally accompanied by the MASTER CAUTION
light, tone, and INS ATT caution. Place the attitude select switch in the STBY position,
crosscheck the HUD against standby instruments, and attempt an in-flight alignment.
Due to the tendency of the standby attitude reference indicator to precess, it is suggested that
flying in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) using the ARI as a primary attitude
reference be minimized. A partial IFA (In-Flight Alignment) is always recommended whenever
possible to recover the INS attitude platform.
b. HUD Symbology Degrades with Air Data Function Failure. An air data function
failure in the FCC results in loss of associated data from the HUD display as shown in figure
2-53. Such a failure also inhibits operation of cruise flight Automatic Throttle Control and
disables the altitude signal used for IFF altitude reporting. An air data function failure may
affect cabin air flow and cabin air temperature.
The pressure transmitter set can produce erroneous signals without cautions or advisories if
the pitot tube or AOA probes receive damage. As the air data function degrades, loss of some
or all of the following data from the HUD may occur:
(1) Calibrated airspeed or barometric altitude. The loss of calibrated airspeed and/or barometric altitude data results in activation of the landing gear handle warning light and tone
with the gear UP. Aircrew action is to reference the applicable standby airspeed or altitude
indicator and then silence the tone.
(2) Angle of Attack. Loss of AOA in three or more FCC CHs causes AOA to be removed from
the HUD.
(3) Vertical velocity indicator. Pilot action on loss of the vertical velocity indication is to check
that the aircraft is in the NAV master mode and to reference the standby vertical velocity
indicator.
(4) Mach number. Pilot action on loss of the Mach number indication is to reference the
standby airspeed indicator.
If an AOA probe becomes jammed (does not move), the FCC continues to receive valid signals until
the pilot executes a maneuver that causes the reading between the AOA probes to differ more than 15°
A1-F18EA-NFM-000

in UA or 5.5 to 15° in PA, depending on sideslip. HUD displayed airspeed may be inaccurate without
annunciation if a pitot tube is damaged.
A jammed, blocked, or damaged pitot tube/AOA probe may not be
annunciated if system errors are not large enough to set a caution. Be
alert for unannunciated pitot static and AOA errors during flight in icing
conditions or if damage is suspected after a bird strike or IFR basket
impact during inflight refueling.
Air data inputs from the MC are used by the INS to help smooth or dampen pitch ladder and
velocity vector position. A complete air data function failure does not immediately affect the pitch
ladder/velocity vector, but these displays eventually degrade. If subtle damage to the AOA probe is
suspected, the pilot should make a crosscheck of airspeed with a wingman if possible. The standby
airspeed indicator receives signals from the left pitot static probe, so it is accurate if only the right
probe is damaged. AOA checks with a wingman should be made in landing configuration if a jammed
AOA probe is suspected. Crosschecking in cruise configuration may give a satisfactory crosscheck, but
the probe may be bent in such a way that AOA anomalies are accentuated on landing configuration.
Landing with automatic throttle control (ATC) may be affected. If damage is suspected, ATC during
landing is not recommended.
When AOA is declared invalid (e.g., AOA Four Channel failure), the HUD AOA display and AOA
bracket are removed and the AOA indexer lights and approach lights are inoperative. GAIN ORIDE
provides fixed gains to the FCS and allows the pilot to select, through the FCS status display, either
the left or right probe. The center (INS) AOA value allows the pilot to compare AOA values to select
the undamaged probe. Once selected, this probe drives the HUD AOA display, AOA bracket, AOA
indexer, and approach lights. If the incorrect probe is selected, the information provided to the pilot
and LSO may be in error but has no impact on the flight control system as the gains are fixed. Notify
the LSO that a single probe has been selected.
2.19.4.6.12 HUD Advisory Data Symbology. The displays in figure 2-52 show some of the advisories
that can appear on the HUD in the NAV master mode. The advisories are associated with nose wheel
steering and approach power compensator. Although the advisories are shown on the gear down
display, most of them can appear on the basic HUD display. Refer to Part VII for description of data
link system and advisories.
The automatic throttle control/nosewheel steering advisories are displayed above the distance
display whenever the ATC or the NWS is engaged. If the ATC is disengaged by any means other than
actuation of the ATC engage/disengage switch, the advisory is flashed for 10 seconds before it is
removed from the display or, if a pilot attempt to engage ATC is not successful, ATC is flashed for 10
seconds and removed.
2.19.4.6.13 HUD BIT Checks. The HUD has two methods of built-in tests: manually initiated and
automatic test. Refer to BIT-Status Monitoring Subsystem for the procedures and displays used for
the HUD BIT checks.
2.19.4.7 CRS Set Switch. The course set switch manually sets the desired course on the HSI display.
2.19.4.8 HDG/TK Set Switch. The heading/ground track set switch manually sets the heading
marker on the desired heading/ground track on the HSI display.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-165 ORIGINAL
2.19.5 Up Front Control Display (UFCD). The UFCD is on the main instrument panel below the
HUD in the front cockpit. In the rear cockpit, the UFCD is located below the MPCD in LOTs 21 thru
25, and above the MPCD or 8 x 10 display in LOT 26 AND UP. The UFCD is an active matrix liquid
crystal display with an IR touchscreen used for data entry inputs consisting of digits or NEWS, and
control of the CNI systems (autopilot modes, IFF, TACAN, ILS, data link, radar beacon, UHF/VHF
radios, and ADF), see figure 2-55. In addition, the touchscreen can be used as a multi-function display
for display formats, including video. The UFCD is used in conjunction with the two DDIs, the 8 x 10
display and the MPCD to enter navigation, sensor, and weapon delivery data. UFCD option selections
and inputs are transmitted directly to the MPCD and on to the mission computers. (The mission
computers pass these inputs to the control converter (CC) for CNI equipment control). The UFCD is
NVG compatible. In the F/A-18F, the front and rear cockpit UFCDs operate independently. When
different formats are being displayed, the only data common to both UFCDs is radio channel and
frequency information. Both cockpit UFCDs present the results of changes to radio channels or
frequencies at the same time, regardless of which cockpit performed the change. The cockpit not
performing data entry does not see touch highlights as the data is entered, only the result of the data
entry. If both pilot and WSO enter digits on the keypad for the same option, both entries are accepted,
with the second entry overwriting the first. When pilot and WSO are on the same data entry or CNI
format, asterisks are provided in the top left and right of the scratch pad.
(LOT 26 AND UP) The aft UFCD is electrically controlled through the 8 x 10 display Off/On/
Brightness knob when it is installed. The aft UFCD flashes STANDBY when the MC1 communication
to the UFCD is disrupted. A standby display pattern in the the center of the UFCD display surface,
similar to the DDI pattern, indicates degraded image processing from MC1. When the Mono video
connection from the 8 x 10 display is lost or degraded, the aft UFCD will not display anything. When
video synchronization is lost or degraded, the aft UFCD may display symbology that is not coordinated
with the video. If the interface between MC1 and the aft UFCD is lost, the touch screen capability and
brightness/contrast control will not work. When MC1 is inoperative, the aft UFCD is not capable of
displaying format symbology or analog video.
When the pilot or WSO touch a keypad option on the touch screen a highlight appears indicating
that the option has been selected. Figure 2-55 shows an example of a selected option. When a new
format is selected on the touchpad, the highlight does not remain on the new format.
Keypad options use a first finger in mechanization. Only one option can be selected at a time. If two
or more selections are attempted at one time, none of them are considered valid.
Some formats initialize with data in the scratchpad, e.g., the COMM sublevel of the CNI format
initializes with the comm frequency in the scratchpad. When data entry is started, the digits in the
scratchpad are blanked, allowing data entry. If a comm frequency is being entered the decimal remains
displayed, allowing frequency entry in relation to the decimal point to be viewed.
The UFCD uses a double clear mechanism. The first selection of the CLR keypad option removes the
last digit that was entered in the scratchpad. The second selection of the CLR option removes all the
digits which have been entered in the scratchpad. If the scratchpad is flashing due to the 10 second
timer (no entries in the previous 10 seconds), pressing CLR stops the flashing and performs the
previously described CLR function. If the scratchpad is flashing due to an error, pressing CLR stops
the flashing and removes all digits from the scratchpad.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-166 ORIGINAL
Uncommanded option selections may occur with a malfunctioning
UFCD. This can include uncommanded autopilot selection or deselection. In order to reduce the flight safety risk, a UFCD that self-selects
uncommanded options should be secured in flight and only turned on if
required for safety-of-flight functions (radio, IFF or navigation selections). The malfunction may or may not be present when turned back on,
but can be expected to reoccur during flight if operational. In F/A−18F
aircraft, an unaffected UFCD may remain on and in use with no adverse
effect. A frozen unresponsive display is the result of another unrelated
failure mode that may occur and can be corrected by cycling power to the
MPCD/DECD.
NOTE
Securing the UFCD will reset the MPCD/DECD and cause a transitory
display loss.
2.19.5.1 UFCD Data Entry. The UFCD has two data entry protocols, Standard Data Entry (SDE)
and Fast Data Entry (FDE).
2.19.5.1.1 Standard Data Entry. With MC OFP 18E, SDE digits are entered using the keyboard
followed by the enter (ENT) key. In many cases, the option for which the data is being entered must
first be selected prior to entering digits. Selection of the ENT option causes the digits in the scratchpad
to flash once, confirming that the ENT has been accepted. The majority of the data entry displays use
SDE protocol and are recognized by the presence of the ENT key.
2.19.5.1.2 Fast Data Entry. With MC OFP 18E some data, and with MC OFP H1E AND UP all data
are entered using the keyboard followed by selecting the option directly. This protocol does not use the
enter (ENT) key. With MC OFP 18E, MAN replaces ENT. With MC OFP H1E AND UP, NEWS
replaces ENT. See figure 2-54.
2.19.5.1.3 Data Entry Using the Shifted Keypad. The N-E-W-S option is provided on all UFCD
data entry displays with MC OFP H1E AND UP. The shifted keypad provides the ability to enter a
negative sign, a decimal point, degrees, minutes, and seconds symbols, and North (N), East (E), West
(W), and South (S) entries for latitude and longitude entries. With MC OFP H2E+ AND UP, latitude
and longitude can be entered to ten thousandths of a minute, or hundredths of a second for increased
precision.
2.19.5.2 UFCD CNI Function. The aircraft powers up with all CNI systems off and the top level CNI
format as the default UFCD display. See figure 2-55. This format is the central point for controlling all
CNI systems. For Communication-Identification Equipment, see Chapter 23. For Navigation Equipment, see Chapter 24.
The following top level options are not related to CNI systems: DDI, EW, and FLR. The DDI option
provides the last selected DDI display on the UFCD. The EW and FLR options provide the specified
display format on the UFCD.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-167 ORIGINAL
The top level CNI display does not use an ENT function, the MAN option is used to turn to a
previously entered manual radio frequency.
2.19.5.3 UFCD STANDBY Indication. A flashing STANDBY indication is provided just above the
center of the UFCD display surface when there is no valid mux communication between the MC and
MPCD. The STANDBY indication is superimposed over any display format. When the STANDBY
indication is displayed, power to the MPCD should be cycled to attempt a reset. If the STANDBY
condition clears before power can be recycled, the UFCD screen blanks and the previously displayed
format reappears.
2.19.5.3.1 Aft UFCD MUX FAIL. When the 8 x 10 display is installed, the aft UFCD generates a MUX
FAIL BIT indication when MC1 loses communication with the UFCD. This message occurs only when
the 8 x 10 display is turned on and powering the aft UFCD. Using periodic BIT monitoring, the MC1
tries to reset the aft UFCD through the 8 x 10 display communication if an error is detected.
2.19.5.4 RALT - Radar Altimeter Function. The RALT function indicates clearance over land or
water from 0 to 5,000 feet. Operation is based on precise measurement of time required for an
electromagnetic energy pulse to travel from the aircraft to the ground and return. A warning tone and
visual warnings are activated when the aircraft is at or below a selectable primary or secondary low
altitude limit. The primary/secondary radar low altitude warnings are reset by setting the low altitude
index (primary), or UFCD selected altitude (secondary) to an altitude below the present altitude or by
climbing above the previously set limit. The warning tone can be disabled in either cockpit by pressing
the flashing RALT option on the UFCD Low Altitude Warnings format or UFCD DDI format, turning
off the radar altimeter, setting the warning value below current radar altitude, or by climbing above the
warning altitude. When disabled, the tone cannot be triggered until after being reset as described.

The radar altimeter consists of a receiver-transmitter and individual transmitting and receiving
antennas. The receiver-transmitter produces the energy pulses, transmits the energy to the ground,
receives the reflected signal, and processes the data for display as altitude by the head-up display unit
(HUD).
Indicators and controls used with the electronic altimeter set are the left or right DDI on the
instrument panel (for BIT checks), the ALT switch, UFCD (for secondary low altitude warning), and
the head-up display. Radar altimeter BIT is initiated from the BIT display.
Pressing the emission control (EMCON) switch on the UFCD inhibits operation of the radar
altimeter. EMCON is toggled on or off each time the EMCON switch is pressed. When EMCON is on
the letters E, M, C, O, N are displayed either in the left side option boxes (DDI display) or in the
scratchpad of the top level CNI display and on the HUD.
2.19.5.4.1 Low Altitude Warning Tone. When the aircraft descends below the primary low altitude
set in the UFCD, a ‘‘Whoop, Whoop’’ warning tone is heard in the aircrew’s headset and the word
ALTITUDE is displayed on the HUD. The warning tone, when initiated by the primary radar low
altitude warning, is repeated at the lowest priority until reset or disabled.
Numbers ending in zero are valid entries for both the Low Altitude
Warning and COMM 1. Due to the close proximity of the COMM 1 and
RALT options, it is possible to inadvertently change the low altitude
warning setting for the radar altimeter when attempting to use COMM 1
fast data entry.
A barometric low altitude and secondary radar low altitude warning function are enabled by entering
the appropriate altitude, up to a maximum of 25,000 (BARO) and 5,000 (RADAR), on the UFCD. The
barometric low altitude and secondary radar low altitude warning provide a single voice alert warning
“ALTITUDE, ALTITUDE” when the aircraft descends through the selected altitude. Refer to Part VII
for information on entering altitude. The barometric low altitude warning function does not affect the
operation of the radar altimeter low altitude warning function.
2.19.5.5 UFCD Controls. A description of UFCD switches follows. Refer to Part VII for operating
instructions for CNI equipment.
2.19.5.5.1 COMM 1 and 2 Channel Knobs. The COMM 1 and 2 channel knobs permit independent
selection of up to 20 preset channels on radios 1 and 2. Guard (G), Manual (M), Ship Maritime (S), and
SINCGARS Cue (C) channels are also available on the continuously rotatable knobs.
2.19.5.5.2 COMM VOL Knobs. The VOL knobs independently control radio volume for COMM 1 and
2. The OFF position (detent) is at the full counterclockwise position. In the F/A-18F, both sets of knobs
must be in the OFF position for power to be removed from the radios. When a radio is powered, the
respective COMM option is corner highlighted. When a radio is actively receiving, a half intensity
highlight is shown on the upper half of the COMM option (figure 2-55).
2.19.5.5.3 ID (IDENT) Pushbutton. The ID pushbutton commands an IFF identification/position
squawk (IDENT), for modes 1, 2, and 3 (if enabled).
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-170 ORIGINAL
2.19.5.5.4 UFCD BRT Knob. The BRT knob adjusts the overall brightness of the UFCD display, both
symbology and video. Turning the knob counterclockwise to the OFF position removes power from the
UFCD.
2.19.5.5.5 UFCD CONT Knob. The CONT knob adjusts video contrast on the UFCD.
2.19.5.5.6 UFCD SYM Knob. The SYM knob is used to adjust the brightness of the UFCD symbology
without affecting the brightness of the UFCD video.
2.19.5.5.7 EMCON Pushbutton. If the UFCD is displaying a DDI format the letters E M C O N are
displayed in the left side option boxes. If the UFCD is displaying the top level CNI format, EMCON
is displayed in the scratch pad.
2.19.6 SDC - Signal Data Computer. The signal data computer (SDC) operates under mission
computer control and records aircraft fatigue strain data, engine parameters when out of tolerance
conditions occur, fuel information, and aircraft and target parameters when targets are designated and
weapons are delivered. It includes fuel transfer controls and gaging capabilities, incorporates ground
support equipment fuel transfer and gaging fault isolation functions, and provides interface for
multiple sensors and controls. It provides analog-to-digital conversion of aircraft parameters. In
addition, BIT fail indications are stored in the SDC to be displayed by the maintenance status panel
(MSP) for readout by maintenance personnel after the flight, or on the EFD for readout during the
flight.
The RESET SDC option is available from the SUPT MENU/FUEL format. This option is used to
reset the SDC by momentarily removing power. When selected, the RESET portion of the option
legend is boxed, and remains boxed until the SDC reestablishes AVMUX communication or 15 seconds
after the option was selected. The RESET SDC option is removed from the FUEL format if the CSC
is not communicating on the AVMUX.
With AMCD aircraft, the SDC is used to compensate for periods of blank cockpit displays and
interrupted avionics multiplex (AVMUX) bus communication occurring when both advanced MCs are
off-line or in initialization. The SDC will take temporary control of AVMUX busses 1 and 6 during the
ground start and inflight conditions. While acting as the backup bus controller, the SDC transmits to
the forward MPCD and forward UFCD a limited HUD display of essential flight information. Refer to
chapter 25. Additional data transfers to the left and right Full Authority Digital Engine Controllers
(FADECs) and the Environmental Control System (ECS) Controller sustains standard operation. The
SDC also enables display of the Left and Right Air Turbine Starter (L ATS and R ATS) cautions.
2.19.7 CVRS - Cockpit Video Recording System. LOTs 21−24 CVRS contains two video tape
recorders, a HUD camera, and two over the shoulder cameras. The system has the capability to record
either front DDI, the MPCD, the HMD, the aft MPCD, the aft UFCD, or the HUD (in color), but in
limited combinations. Headset audio is also recorded as long as the KY−58 encryption function is
inactive. The switches used to operate CVRS are located on the VIDEO RECORD panel in each
cockpit.
The CVRS in LOT 25 is identical to that for LOTS 21−24 with the exception of the two
over−the−shoulder cameras which are removed and the DDIs are recorded using direct video outputs.
In LOTs 26 and up without the solid state recorder, the CVRS consists of two video tape recorders
and a HUD camera. No over the shoulder cameras are installed. The system has the capability to direct
record various combinations of either front DDI, aft DDI, MPCD, aft MPCD or 8 x 10 display, the
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-171 ORIGINAL
HMD, and the HUD in color. Headset audio is also recorded as long as the KY−58 encryption function
is inactive. The switches to operate the CVRS are located on the VIDEO RECORD panel in each
cockpit.
With AMCD aircraft with solid state recorder (SSR) installed (after AFC 443), the CVRS consists
of one SSR with removable memory module (RMM). The system has the same record options and
cockpit interface as the 8 mm CVRS.
2.19.7.1 CVRS Video Tape Recorders/Solid State Recorder (SSR). The two CVRS video tape
recorders (VTRs) are located behind the ejection seat in the F/A−18E and behind the rear cockpit
ejection seat in the F/A−18F. Each VTR provides a minimum of 2 hours recording time on removable
8 mm video tape cartridges.
The SSR is located in the avionics bay behind the ejection seat in the F/A-18E and behind the rear
cockpit ejection seat in the F/A−18F. VTR1 and VTR2 record options are the same as CVRS. The SSR
provides a minimum of 3 hours recording time on a removable memory module (RMM).
2.19.7.1.1 SECURE ERASE Button. The SECURE ERASE button is guarded and located on the
right hand forward vertical console. Pressing the SECURE ERASE button erases the information
stored in the RMM.
2.19.7.1.2 SSR Advisories. The following SSR related advisories are described in the Warning/
Caution/Advisory Displays in part V: RMMCD, RMMFL.
2.19.7.2 HUD Camera. The HUD camera, positioned immediately in front of the HUD, records a
color image similar to what the pilot sees through the HUD, e.g., symbology superimposed on a picture
of the outside world. This combined image is made available for recording.
2.19.7.2.1 HUD Event Marker. The HUD event marker is a small black marker generated by the
HUD camera and positioned in the upper left corner of the video signal sent to the VTR for recording.
The event marker is displayed when the weapon release pickle button is pressed or the trigger is
squeezed to the second detent and remains displayed until pickle button/trigger release. When
reviewing CVRS video post−flight, the event marker is a useful training aid, used to determine the
timing and duration of pickle button and trigger actuations (e.g., shot validation).
2.19.7.2.2 HUD Camera BIT Button. The BIT button, located on the front face of the HUD
assembly, is used to initiate a BIT of the HUD camera. The GO and NO GO BIT status balls, normally
black, are used to determine the BIT status of the HUD camera. When the BIT button is pressed, BIT
status is indicated by a green GO ball or an orange NO GO ball.
2.19.7.3 Over the Shoulder Cameras (LOTs 21−24). Two over the shoulder cameras, one mounted
on each side of the canopy frame approximately 30 inches from the instrument panel, are oriented to
record a picture of the L and RDDIs. The image from each camera is made available to a VTR for
recording.
2.19.7.3.1 Over the Shoulder Camera BIT Buttons (LOTs 21−24). Each camera contains a BIT
button located on its front face. Press and hold of the BIT button initiates a BIT of that camera. BIT
status is indicated by a green LED (go) or a red LED (fail).
2.19.7.4 CVRS Control Switches. The switches used to operate CVRS are located on the VIDEO
RECORD panel on the lower left instrument panel in the forward cockpit, and the aft cockpit for LOTs
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-172 ORIGINAL
21−25 aircraft. (See figures 2-56 thru 2-64) They are located below the center display in the aft cockpit
of LOT 26 AND UP aircraft. The aft cockpit switches override the front cockpit switches for any
selection on LOT 26 AND UP aircraft. The VTR 1 and VTR 2 sources are grouped to nominally allow
front cockpit recording on VTR 2 (includes HUD) and allow aft cockpit recording on VTR 1 (includes
8 x 10 display).
2.19.7.4.1 CVRS Mode Switch. The CVRS mode switch is used to select manual or automatic video
recording.
MAN CVRS records continuously (according to the inputs
selected by the two VTR selector switches).
OFF CVRS recording off.
AUTO CVRS records automatically only when in the A/A or A/G master modes (according to the inputs selected by the two VTR selector switches).
NOTE
The MODE switch must be in the OFF position to remove power from
the VTRs. Failure to place the MODE switch in the proper position
prior loss of aircraft power will keep the 8mm tapes from dethreading
and prevent the removal of the tapes from the VTRs until aircraft
power is reapplied.
2.19.7.4.2 CVRS RDCR ON Light. The green RDCR ON light, located on the left warning/caution/
advisory lights panel on the upper left instrument panel, comes on when CVRS power is on. An
illuminated light does not mean that the VTR or SSR is recording.
2.19.7.4.3 VTR Selector Switches. The VTR selector switches are used to select the video input
source for recording on the two VTRs.

NOTE
In LOT 26 AND UP F−model aircraft both aft VTR switches must be
in the FWD position AND the forward MODE switch must be in the
OFF position to remove power from the VTRs. Failure to place all 3
switches in the proper position prior loss of aircraft power will keep
the 8mm tapes from dethreading and prevent the removal of the tapes
from the VTRs until aircraft power is reapplied.
2.19.7.5 VTR2 Override Function. CVRS incorporates a VTR2 override function designed to make
sure that HUD camera video is recorded when an A/G weapon is released, the gun is fired, or an A/A
missile is launched. In A/A or A/G master modes, when the pickle button is pressed or the trigger is
squeezed to the second detent, VTR2 automatically switches from the selected VTR2 source to the
HUD camera. VTR2 records HUD video from pickle button/trigger actuation to pickle button/trigger
release plus a set overrun time before reverting to the video source selected by the VTR2 selector
switch. Overrun times are 5 seconds for AIM−9 launch and gun firing and 10 seconds for AIM−7/
AIM−120 launch and A/G weapon release. In the A/G master mode, if FLIR video is displayed on a
DDI, the UFCD, or the MPCD, VTR2 does not switch to record HUD camera video.
2.19.8 Fast Tactical Imaging Set (FTI-II). The FTI-II (AN/AVX-4) provides the F/A-18F (LOT 24
AFTER AFC 395) with near real-time capability to capture, view, send, and receive cockpit display
information as still-frame images in either air-to-air or air-to-ground mode. FTI-II captures any of 5
single-source video inputs from one of the following displays: aft LDDI, aft RDDI, HUD, aft MPCD,
and forward HMD. The system sends parallel video to the forward and aft DDIs for image viewing
when the monochrome map is selected for display. An additional output signal is sent to VTR1 for
recording. Transmitted and received imagery is encrypted using the KY-58 secure speech system and
the ARC-210 radio.
2.19.8.1 FTI-II Major Components.
2.19.8.1.1 Remote Switching Control (RSC). The RSC is installed on the aft cockpit left hand
console aft of the volume control panel. The RSC has two lines of 24 characters each and six buttons,
and is used for programming the FTI-II and executing commands.
2.19.8.1.2 Digital Imaging Processor (DIP). The DIP is installed in the forward cockpit, right hand
console just aft of the KY-58 control panel. The DIP has a removable compact flash card that stores
full resolution images. The DIP contains a CPU, communications protocol, LPEG software, wavelet
software, operating system software, frame grabber function, and a Merlin card for auto detection and
down-scale conversion.
2.20 TACTICAL AIRCRAFT MOVING MAP CAPABILITY (TAMMAC)
The TAMMAC avionics subsystem provides a moving map capability to enhance operational
effectiveness and survivability and addresses supportability/obsolescence issues facing existing moving
map and data storage systems currently deployed.
TAMMAC effectively replaces 3 separate Weapons Replaceable Assemblies (WRAs), including the
AN/ASQ-196 DVMS which consists of two WRAs; the Digital Map Computer (DMC) and the Digital
Memory Unit (DMU), and the AN/ASQ-194 DSS which is a single WRA.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-178 ORIGINAL
(LOT 26 AND UP) Independent maps and related formats are available in both cockpits with
Digital Video Map Computer (DVMC) installed, allowing independent map functionality and video
routing. The DVMC provides 5 outputs through two channels to various aircraft displays; however,
each map channel output is not available on every display. DVMC Channel 1 (using MC1) has two
analog video outputs. One output is viewable on the front LDDI, MPCD and rear LDDI. The other
channel 1 output is used for the aft UFCD. DVMC Channel 2 (using MC2) has two analog video
outputs and one digital color fiber optic output. One of the analog outputs is viewable on the front and
rear RDDIs, and 8 x 10 display. The other analog output is used for Wrap-Around-Test (WAT) and
removes video capability from the front UFCD. Channel 2 digital (fiber optic) is only available on the
8 x 10 display. When the Channel 2 digital output is in use on the 8 x 10 display, the analog outputs
are disabled. The DVMC only produces digital or analog on Channel 2 at any time, not both
simultaneously.
The 8 x 10 display processes analog video (via MC1 or MC2) or digital video, via Fiber Channel
Network Switch (FCNS) 2 along with the symbology received from MC2 to create a composite format
display image. FLIR mono video and map mono video (Wrap-Around-Test only) are the only analog
videos routed to the 8 x 10 display. The aft UFCD video displays are routed through the 8 x 10 display
for processing, and include sensor, weapon, and TAMMAC DVMC. Digital color map video on the 8 x
10 display is routed from the TAMMAC DVMC via the High Speed Video Network (HSVN) and
FCNS2. If FCNS2 fails, no digital color video is available on the 8 x 10 display. Map video routing is
shown in figure 2-65.
The TAMMAC subsystem consists of a new MU-1119/A Advanced Memory Unit (AMU), a new
CP-2414/A digital map computer and a High Speed Interface Bus (HSIB) which connects the two. The
DMC is a functional replacement for the existing DVMS. Data Transfer Devices (DTDs) used in
conjunction with TAMMAC for transferring data to and from ground-based stations are Personal
Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) cards or PC cards. Ground-based
stations that process data for TAMMAC include the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) and the
Automated Maintenance Environment (AME). Theater data is installed on the map loading card using
JMPS.
The AMU is a functional replacement for the existing DSS, more commonly referred to as the
Memory Unit (MU). The AMU contains two PC card receptacles, one for maintenance (ground
support) operations and one for mission (pilot) operations. This unique configuration allows maintenance and mission data to be separated both pre- and post-flight which reduces logistics coordination
and facilitates operational readiness. Three types of PC cards are used in the TAMMAC subsystem
operation: 1) Mission Card, 2) Maintenance Card, and 3) Map Loading Card.
2.20.1 TAMMAC Status Monitoring. TAMMAC status monitoring functions are based on the
existing MU and DVMS status monitoring functionality. Some of the existing cautions, advisories, BIT
mechanizations, and MSP codes that satisfied the requirements for the MU and DVMS were not
changed. However, additional status monitoring functionality was added to accommodate changes to
the MC/AMU/DMC interfaces including, but not limited to, the PC cards and the High Speed
Interface Bus (HSIB).
All existing display references to the MU and DMC are unchanged. The TAMMAC AMU functionality
discussed here equates to the MU nomenclature on all existing displays. The TAMMAC DMC equates
to the DMC on all existing displays. The only operator change to the status monitoring BIT displays
is the addition of the AMU MAINT option.

The MC verifies the AMU and DMC software configuration IDs are compatible with the MC
software.
2.20.2 AMU Maintenance Format Options and Display Information. The AMU maintenance
format contains two relay mode options, MAP LOAD and MBIT. MAP LOAD provides access to
sublevel formats used to upload map theater data to the DMC. MBIT is used for troubleshooting and
fault isolation.
Information displayed on the AMU maintenance format is limited to the MU OFP configuration ID.
The OFP CONFIG identifies the OFP version currently installed in the AMU. See figure 2-66.
2.20.3 Map Theater Data Loading. Map theater data loading can include either updates to an
existing theater load or a new theater load. In both cases, the map loading cards are processed on JMPS
and loaded in the DMC nonvolatile mass memory using the same procedure. The number of map
loading cards is contingent on the size of the update or new theater load. The number of map loading
cards can be as few as one or as many as seven.
Map theater data loading is controlled by the map loading format. The map loading format is
accessed by selecting the MAP LOAD option (PB 11) on the AMU maintenance format as shown in
figure 2-67. The map loading format contains 3 relay mode options; LOAD, ABORT, and RTN.
2.20.4 Map Loading Format Options. The LOAD option (PB 11) is used to initiate a theater load
when a map loading card is installed in the AMU maintenance card receptacle and the AMU door is
closed. Once the process is initiated, the LOAD option is removed from the format. Multiple card
theater loads/updates require the insertion of another map card when prompted by the DDI display.
Installing another map loading card and closing the AMU door continues the theater loading process.
This procedure is repeated until all theater data is loaded. Map loading cards can be loaded in any
sequence.
The ABORT option (PB 13) is used to abort a theater load in progress. It is removed from the
display prior to and after completion of a load. To initiate an abort, the operator presses PB 13 which
changes the option to ABORT ENABLE. Selection of ABORT ENABLE executes the abort process.
Figure 2-66. AMU Maintenance Format
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-181 ORIGINAL
The ABORT ENABLE legend is displayed for 3 seconds following selection of the ABORT option. If
the operator does not select the ABORT ENABLE option within three seconds, the ABORT legend is
redisplayed. The intent of this two-step abort process is to preclude any inadvertent operator initiated
aborts from being performed. This abort process is permanent and the entire load process will be
terminated.
Aborting a theater map load causes the aborted theater to be deleted. No maps in CHRT, DTED,
or CIB will be available if a theater load is aborted. Previous theater maps are automatically deleted
upon loading a new theater.
The RTN option (PB 15) is used to return the AMU maintenance format if a theater load is not in
progress. If a theater load is in progress, the RTN option is removed from the display.
2.20.5 Map Loading Format Status Information. Status information displayed on the map loading
format provides the operator with on-line instructions and associated feedback necessary to perform a
successful theater load. The information presented is grouped into several status fields; THEATER,
STATUS, CARD/STATUS, CARD, and OPER.
The THEATER status field contains; theater identification, theater update revision letter, and the
theater update version number that is stored on the map loading card currently being loaded. If at least
one card is not installed in the AMU (to initiate the load), the field is blank. After a map loading card
is loaded the theater identification information remains displayed as other cards are loaded.
The status field below the THEATER status field contains the overall status of the loading process.
This field contains one of the following status indications:
HALTED - Indicates the load process has been halted (between successive cards).
LOADING - Indicates the load process has been initiated and/or is in progress.
ABORTED - Indicates the load process has been aborted.
NO DMS COMM - Indicates HSIB communications with the DMC have failed.
Figure 2-67. Map Loading Format
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-182 ORIGINAL
DMS FULL - Indicates the DMC nonvolatile mass memory is full.
LOAD ERROR - Indicates the load process has failed.
WRONG CARD - Indicates the card installed in the AMU maintenance card receptacle is not a Map
loading card.
COMPLETE - Indicates the load process has successfully been completed.
CARD/STATUS fields contain status information regarding the PC cards used in the loading
process. The CARD field indicates the card ID number(s) in the theater load card set. The maximum
number of card IDs that can be displayed is seven. The card ID number(s) displayed is dependent on
which order the cards are loaded. The STATUS field below the CARD field contains the actual load
status of the card number directly above it. Once the card is installed and the load process initiated,
the field contains one of the following status indications:
L - Indicates the card is currently being loaded.
F - Indicates the card has failed to load properly.
C - Indicates the card has been successfully loaded.
If none of the above conditions exists, the STATUS field will be blank. If any card fails to load
properly resulting in an ″F″ status, the operator has the option of reinserting the card in an attempt to
obtain a successful load.
The CARD field contains the load status of the card that is currently installed. The card ID number
will be displayed followed by the percent complete (%) for the card. The percentage will be displayed
in 1% increments.
The OPER field contains instructions for the operator. The field contains one of the following
instructional status indications. If any card has yet to be installed for loading, the OPER field will be
blank.
INIT LOAD - Indicates the AMU is ready to start the load process and the LOAD option needs to be
selected.
CLOSE DOOR - Indicates the AMU door needs to be closed.
REMOVE CARD - Indicates the installed card has been successfully loaded and needs to be removed.
INSERT CARD - Indicates another card is required to complete the load process.
2.20.6 Map Loading Interruptions. Interruptions to the map theater data loading process can occur
as a result of several events: loss of power to the MC, DMC, or AMU, operator aborts, or inadvertent
transfers out of AMU relay mode.
If the AMU experiences a power loss greater than 5 seconds, or if the DMC experiences a power loss
of any duration, or if the operator initiates an abort, the interruption in the loading process results in
a nonrecoverable abort and the load process cannot be recovered without reloading all the cards.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-183 ORIGINAL
If power is reapplied to the AMU within 5 seconds, then the load process can be recovered with
minimum impacts. Once the operator reselects the map loading format, the status of the load prior to
the interruption is reflected on the format status fields. If a card was in the process of being loaded
when the interruption occurred, its status is blank indicating it has not been loaded. Selecting the
LOAD option reinitializes the load process following this type of interruption.
2.20.7 AMU/PC Cards Cautions and Advisories. The AMU has the ability to trigger 3 caution and
5 advisory messages. The caution messages are: MU LOAD, ERASE FAIL, and S/W CONFIG. The
advisory messages are: Maintenance Card Advisory (MNTCD), Mission Card Advisory (MSNCD),
Classified Data Advisory (CDATA), AMU Full advisory (AMU FL), and the BIT advisory.
The MU LOAD caution is generated when the AMU door is open; if the AMU fails; if the AMU
declares a card interface fail; if the AMU is mux fail or not ready; if the mission card is improperly
formatted, not installed, or is declared failed by the AMU, if the initialization data is not downloaded,
if an incorrect checksum is calculated. The MU LOAD caution is disabled while the AMU is in relay
mode or the aircraft is in flight.
The ERASE FAIL caution is generated when the AMU has failed to erase its internal RAM memory
buffer following a classified data transfer.
The S/W CONFIG caution is generated if the AMU and MC software are not compatible. When an
AMU OFP checksum failure occurs, the AMU OFP software configuration ID displayed on the S/W
configuration BIT sublevel format indicates XXXXXXXX.
The MNTCD advisory is generated when the AMU door is open, if the maintenance card is not
installed or properly formatted, or if the AMU declares a maintenance card failure. The advisory only
displays with WonW and clears in flight.
The MSNCD advisory is generated when the AMU door is open, or if there is an AMU/PC card
interface fail, or if a down load of data is incorrect, or there is a checksum failure with the data
downloaded, or if the mission card is not installed, or if the mission card is not properly formatted, or
if there is a mission card failure. The advisory only displays with WonW and clears in flight.
The BIT advisory is generated when the AMU is degraded or an AMU RAM classified erase failure
occurs.
The CDATA advisory is generated when the mission card contains classified data. It is removed
when a successful classified data erase of all avionics has been performed, or a successful classified data
erase of all avionics except the mission card is performed and the ERASE (MU HOLD) option has been
selected on the MUMI format.
The MU FL advisory used for the existing MU is changed for the AMU. The MU FL advisory
indicates a data wraparound has occurred on the maintenance card and the corresponding MSP code
(809) is set. When the MC determines there is not enough memory on the maintenance card to perform
the next sequential write operation, it begins overwriting previously recorded data.
DFIRS data download requests do not cause a data wraparound to occur. If there is insufficient
memory available, based on the current sequential write address pointer, the DFIRS data download
request is not executed.

2.21 COUNTERMEASURES DISPENSING SYSTEM
2.21.1 ALE-47 Countermeasures Dispensing Set. The ALE-47 countermeasures dispensing set can
be manually actuated or can use information from various Electronic Warfare (EW) systems to
generate countermeasures dispensing programs. Refer to A1-F18EA-TAC series for details on ALE-47
operation and displays.
2.21.1.1 DISPENSER Switch. The DISPENSER switch, located on the center pedestal, is used to
control power to the ALE-47 system and to enable the BYPASS dispensing mode.
BYPASS Selects the BYPASS mode for ALE-47 operation.
ON Powers ALE-47. Enables the ALE-47 sublevel on the EW format.
OFF ALE-47 off
2.21.1.2 ALE-47 Advisories. The D LOW advisory is displayed when expendable loadouts drop to the
BINGO level set on the ALE-47 sublevel of the EW format. The D BAD advisory is displayed when a
dispense misfire occurs.
2.21.2 ALE-50 Decoy Dispensing Set. The ALE-50 decoy dispensing set provides an expendable
towed RF countermeasures capability. The system includes a multi-platform launch controller
(MPLC) and a removable dispenser with 3 expendable decoys. Refer to A1-F18EA-TAC series for
details on ALE-50 operation and displays.
2.21.2.1 JAMMER Switch. The JAMMER switch, located on the center pedestal, is used to control
power to the ALE-50 system and to provide a secondary means to sever a deployed towline.
CUT Severs a deployed towline.
ON Powers ALE-50. With WonW, initiates start-up BIT. Enables the ALE-50 sublevel
on the EW format.
OFF ALE-50 off
2.21.2.2 ALE-50 BIT Anomalies. There are currently three anomalies related to ALE-50 BIT, which
can corrupt decoy inventory or damage the MPLC. These anomalies have not yet been corrected, so
care should be taken when ALE-50 BIT is run.
1. When a full ALE-50 dispenser has been installed between flights, a full ALE-50 start-up BIT
must be run with WonW, in order to inventory all decoys. If ALE-50 BIT is not run WonW, the
system defaults to the last known inventory (which is two if one was dispensed on the previous
flight).
2. If the JAMMER switch is placed to OFF while the ALE-50 start-up BIT or IBIT is running, the
decoy inventory can be corrupted and/or the SEVER caution can be inhibited (e.g., no cockpit
indication of a failed decoy is provided).
3. If the ALE-50 BIT is run post-flight after one or more decoys has been dispensed in flight, the
system may arc and damage the MPLC.
Therefore, to avoid the potential loss of ALE-50 operability, aircrew should perform the following
procedures on flights where ALE-50 use is anticipated. Run the ALE-50 start-up BIT and/or IBIT
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-185 ORIGINAL
with WonW prior to flight. Do not place the JAMMER switch to OFF while ALE-50 BIT is running.
If this occurs, place the JAMMER switch back to ON and run another start-up BIT. Turn the
JAMMER switch OFF in flight prior to landing or, at a minimum, do not cycle the JAMMER switch
OFF then ON or initiate ALE-50 IBIT when WonW post-flight.
2.21.2.3 SEVER Caution. The SEVER caution is set under the following conditions: (1) the hook or
landing gear is lowered with an ALE-50 decoy deployed, (2) a deployed decoy fails (AUTO DEPLOY
option not selected), or (3) the signal was sent to sever a towline but the squib did not fire.
2.22 BIT-STATUS MONITORING SUBSYSTEM
The BIT/status monitoring subsystem, provides the aircrew with a simple display of system status.
Most information is derived from BIT mechanizations within the avionics sets and from non-avionic
built in tests implemented in the computer software for other aircraft subsystems.
The subsystem monitors engine and airframe operational status for unit failures and caution/
advisory conditions when the mission computer system is operating. When the mission computer
system detects a caution/advisory condition, it commands display of the applicable caution or advisory
message on one of the DDIs. If the mission computer system detects a unit failure, it commands the
subsystem to store the applicable maintenance code. The mission computer displays the subsystem
BIT results on one of the DDIs.
Non-BIT equipment status includes configuration ID numbers and INS terminal data.
2.22.1 FIRAMS - Flight Incident Recorder and Aircraft Monitoring Set. The FIRAMS consists of a
signal data computer, a data storage set, an engine fuel display, and a maintenance status panel. The
FIRAMS monitors selected engine, airframe, avionic, non-avionic, fuel gauging and consumable
signals. It also performs conversion of sensed measurements, provides real time clock function, outputs
discrete and analog data to associated equipment, communicates with the mission computer, displays
fuel quantities and engine parameters, and performs fuel system health monitoring. FIRAMS also
provides nonvolatile storage for flight incident, maintenance, tactical and fatigue data, and bulk data
input of tactical mission planning data.
2.22.2 DFIRS - Deployable Flight Incident Recorder Set. The DFIRS system consists of the signal
data recorder (SDR), the data transfer interface unit, and the pyrotechnic release system. The SDR
consists of the flight incident recorder memory, beacon, battery, and antenna. DFIRS is contained in
a deployable aerodynamic airfoil located on the top of the fuselage between the rudders. The DFIRS
system stores up to 30 minutes of flight data and, when activated, deploys the SDR along with a rescue
beacon in an airfoil. The SDR is deployed upon pilot ejection or on ground impact. The data stored on
the flight incident recorder (FIR) is gathered by the mission computer from aircraft systems. DFIRS
records flight data, cautions, advisories, and spin data. The FIR memory wraps around to the
beginning when the end of memory is reached. Only the last 30 minutes of each flight is retained. The
MC controls the rate and the type of data that is stored. DFIRS data recording starts when both
throttles are advanced past the vertical, launch bar is lowered, ground speed exceeds 50 knots, or
WoffW and airspeed is over 80 knots. DFIRS recording stops 1 minute after WonW, both throttles less
than the vertical, and the ground speed less than 50 knots. All data with SPIN mode activated are
automatically recorded. A DFIRS DWNLD option is available on the engine display with WonW.
Selecting this option downloads the DFIRS data to the MU for easier retrieval.
2.22.3 Avionics BIT. In most instances, two types of BIT are mechanized, periodic and initiated.
Periodic BIT begins functioning at equipment power application. It provides a failure detection
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-186 ORIGINAL
capability that is somewhat less than that provided by initiated BIT in that it does not interfere with
normal equipment operation.
Two forms of BIT derived data are supplied to the MC. One form is validity information associated
with selected data. The second form is equipment failure information which identifies failed
assemblies. The MC uses these two forms of BIT data to implement reversion operation and advisories
for the aircrew as well as equipment status displays for both the aircrew and maintenance personnel.
2.22.3.1 Reversion. When the BIT equipment determines that a function has exceeded a predetermined threshold, the data derived from that function is immediately indicated as not valid. The MC,
upon receiving this indication, reverts to the next best available source. This source is, in many cases,
as accurate as the original source. This reversion is maintained as long as the data remains invalid from
the primary source.
Figure 2-68 illustrates this concept for the flight aids. For each unit in the primary path, there is at
least one alternate source of data for reversion. The aircrew is provided appropriate display cueing only
when a reversion results in some loss of capability or performance. If the ALT switch is in RDR and
the radar altimeter fails, the MC removes the displayed radar altitude, replaces it with barometric
altitude, and replaces the ″R″ cue with a flashing ″B″ cue. If altitude is lost from the FCC and the
altitude switch is in BARO, the MC removes the displayed altitude from the HUD. These examples
illustrate 3 forms of degraded mode advisories: (1) reversion to an alternate data source of equivalent
accuracy with no cueing; (2) reversion to an alternate data source of lesser accuracy with cueing; (3) and
removal of displayed data when no acceptable alternate source is available. Refer to Part VIII for
further discussion on weapon system reversions.

2.22.3.2 Equipment Status Displays. Equipment status displays (BIT, caution, and advisory)
provide the aircrew with continuous status of the avionics equipment and weapons. A cue to check
equipment BIT status is the appearance of the BIT advisory display on the caution/advisory. The
display is normally on the left DDI. A MENU selectable top level BIT format displays the status of
failed, NOT RDY, or OFF systems of all avionics equipment that interface with the MC. When the BIT
control display is selected on another display, the BIT advisory is removed until another BIT failure
occurs. For aircraft with the 8 x 10 display installed, messages appear as ACNTR. Messages displayed
as a function of equipment status are listed in figure 2-69.
Weapon and stores status is displayed primarily on the stores display (selected from the menu
display). When the BIT display indicates a stores management system (SMS) failure, the affected
stations and degree of failure are identified on the stores display as described in A1-F18EA-TACseries.

2.22.3.2.1 Cautions and Advisories. Cautions and advisories are displayed on the left DDI except
when the left DDI is used for BIT display or weapon video (figure 2-70). When the left DDI is off or
failed, or when the LDDI is used for BIT or weapon video, cautions and advisories are displayed on the
center display. If the left and center displays fail or are turned off, the right DDI displays the cautions
and advisories. Cautions and advisories automatically move to the center display when BIT is selected
on the LDDI. Caution displays appear as 150%-size letters compared to the normal message symbology
size. Cautions are displayed as they occur beginning in the lower left portion of the DDI display and
sequence to the right up to 3 displays across. The fourth caution reindexes to the left edge above the
first caution. A dedicated caution display automatically replaces the HSI display if the number of
cautions exceeds 3 lines. Advisory displays appear as 120%-size letters on a single line beneath the
caution displays. The advisories are preceded by an ADV- legend and the individual advisories are
separated by commas. A caution or advisory is removed when the condition ceases. If there is a caution
or advisory displayed to the right of the removed caution or advisory the display remains blank.
Pressing the MASTER CAUTION light when the light is out repositions the remaining cautions and
advisories to the left and down to fill the blank displays. When a caution occurs, the MASTER
CAUTION light on the main instrument panel illuminates and the MASTER CAUTION tone or a
voice alert is heard in the headset. The MASTER CAUTION light is extinguished by pressing the light.
Refer to Warning/Caution/Advisory Displays in chapter 12 for the display implications and corrective
action procedures.
2.22.3.3 BIT Initiation. In addition to displaying equipment BIT status, the BIT top level and nine
sublevel displays (figure 2-71) are used to command initiated BIT. Those avionics set groups identified
by the legends on the top level display periphery have an initiated BIT capability. BIT may be initiated
for all operating units simultaneously except for some BIT that cannot be performed in flight. Figure
2-71 shows which initiated BIT are not allowed in flight. Additional steps are required to test the INS
and FCS. BIT for individual units within groups may be initiated through the BIT sublevel displays.
Pressing BIT returns to the BIT top level display. Pressing STOP or MENU when BIT is in progress
terminates initiated BIT. Performance of BIT assumes that the required electrical and hydraulic
power is applied to the equipment tested.

2.22.3.3.1 All Equipment. Simultaneous initiated BIT of all equipment installed is performed by
selecting AUTO on the BIT top level display. Equipment group, acronym and status are displayed at
the display options. Equipment group status indicates the lowest operating status reported by any unit
in the tested group. Individual system status results other than GO, PBIT GO, IN TEST, SF TEST,
and OP GO are displayed with a system acronym in the center of the display. If the equipment list is
too long to be displayed on one page, a PAGE pushbutton is displayed. Pressing PAGE displays the
remainder of the list that is on page 2. Pressing PAGE when page 2 is displayed returns page 1.
2.22.3.3.2 Equipment Groups. Initiated BIT of entire equipment groups is performed by selecting
SELBIT (SELBIT option becomes boxed) on the BIT top level display and the desired equipment
group pushbutton. One or more groups can be selected. Another way to select a group is to press the
group pushbutton (with the SELBIT option not boxed) on the BIT top level display and then ALL on
the group sublevel display. See figure 2-71.
2.22.3.3.3 Individual Units. Initiated BIT of an individual unit is performed by pressing the
equipment group pushbutton on the BIT top level display which contains the desired unit. The display
changes to a group sublevel display. Individual units from the group can then be tested by pressing the
pushbutton adjacent to the desired acronym. System status for all systems in the group is displayed on
the center of the display. Some systems require additional aircrew BIT input.
2.22.3.4 System BIT Steps. The following includes certain initiated BIT which require steps in
addition to pressing one of the buttons on the BIT display and reading the BIT status messages after
the test is complete. Figure 2-71 shows which initiated BIT are not allowed in flight.
2.22.3.4.1 FCS Initiated BIT (IBIT). For the FCS to enter IBIT the FCS BIT consent switch must be
held ON. This action prevents inadvertent IBIT initiation inflight for reasons of flight safety.
Control surfaces move during FCS IBIT with hydraulic power applied.
To prevent personnel injury or equipment damage, make sure personnel
and equipment are kept clear of control surfaces.
NOTE
• With the wings folded, both ailerons are Xd out, but no aileron BLIN
codes should be displayed. Even with wings folded, there are aileron
functions tested that may reveal FCS failures via valid BLIN codes.
• For FCS IBIT to start, the FCS BIT consent switch must be held for
at least 2 seconds. If not held for the required time, FCS A and FCS B
will indicate RESTRT on the BIT status line. If RESTRT is displayed, select STOP on the FCS-MC sublevel display and then repeat
the initiation procedure.
• The FCS will not enter IBIT if the throttles are above 14° THA or
NWS is engaged.
• Do not operate any FCS related switches or move the stick or rudder
pedals while FCS IBIT is running, as this may produce false failure
indications
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-193 ORIGINAL
NOTE
• With the wings folded, a BIT status of GO will only be displayed for
approximately 2 seconds before reverting to a DEGD indication. BIT
status will return to GO when the wings are spread and locked.
• If the FCS IBIT fails, FCS A and FCS B will indicate DEGD on the
BIT status line. Note surface Xs and/or BLIN codes and contact
maintenance personnel for disposition.
1. Select MENU-SUPT/BIT/FCS-MC on right DDI.
2. While simultaneously holding FCS BIT consent switch to ON, select the FCS pushbutton on the
FCS-MC sublevel display.
3. Release FCS button and FCS BIT consent switch when FCSA and FCSB BIT status indicates IN
TEST. FCS IBIT requires approximately 1 minute.
NOTE
If IN TEST remains on the FCS BIT display longer than 2 minutes,
select STOP and actuate the paddle switch to exit FCS IBIT.
2.22.3.4.2 Preflight FCS Initiated BIT. The fly-by-wire flight control system uses redundant
hardware to provide continued safe operation after component failures. The level of redundancy
designed into the system was set by component failure rates, failure mode effects, aircraft mission time,
and survivability considerations. The ability to provide safe operation is fundamentally based on the
principle that there are no undetected (e.g., latent) failures prior to flight which would compromise
system redundancy. It is not possible to have an in-flight periodic BIT (PBIT) which can detect all
degradations in a fly-by-wire system. Many redundant pathways can be tested only by setting system
conditions that would be unsafe to establish in flight (e.g., verification of the ability to shut off an
actuator). Preflight FCS initiated BIT was designed to provide those tests and ensure the full
redundancy of the flight control system is available prior to flight. Without running preflight FCS
initiated BIT and performing the necessary maintenance, latent failures present in the system can
result in unsafe conditions should additional failures occur in flight.
2.22.3.4.3 Preflight FCS Initiated BIT Operation. Preflight FCS initiated BIT consists of a series of
tests which verify the integrity of the flight control system processors, actuators, sensors, and cockpit
interfaces.
Preflight FCS initiated BIT begins by testing lower level functions. If preflight FCS initiated BIT
detects a fault at this level which affects higher level functions, it halts and reports the fault(s). If
preflight FCS initiated BIT did not halt at this point, false BLIN codes would be generated on higher
level functions which depend upon the failed lower level function for their operation. If preflight FCS
initiated BIT detects a fault in a subsystem (e.g., left stabilator) testing of the failed subsystem is
discontinued, and testing of unrelated subsystems (e.g., rudders, trailing edge flaps, etc.) continues.
Since testing is not complete, preflight FCS initiated BIT must be run again after maintenance actions
in order to complete all tests.
2.22.3.4.4 Preflight FCS Initiated BIT PASS/FAIL. A successful preflight FCS initiated BIT results
in a GO indication on the DDI. An unsuccessful preflight FCS initiated BIT indicates a system
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-194 ORIGINAL
degradation. A preflight FCS initiated BIT never sets an X on the DDI FCS status page (MENU-FCS)
since preflight FCS initiated BIT only sets BLIN codes. Launching in a degraded state (e.g., with BLIN
codes) places the aircraft in a situation where a portion of the flight control system is operating without
the normal redundancy.
2.22.3.4.5 Repetition of Preflight FCS Initiated BIT. If an aircraft fails preflight FCS initiated BIT
(e.g., BLIN codes present after preflight FCS IBIT) maintenance should be called to troubleshoot the
system. After completing troubleshooting, a successful preflight FCS IBIT is necessary to make sure
the system is fully operational. Except for cold weather operation, preflight FCS IBIT failure is
indicative of a component degradation, e.g., hydraulic or electrical components are out of tolerance, or
a cable conductor is intermittent (broken wire, loose connector pin, etc.).
2.22.3.4.6 FCS Exerciser Mode. In cold weather, actuator components do not respond normally until
hydraulic fluid temperature increases. Exerciser mode should be used to expedite system warm-up.
During exerciser mode, a number of PBIT actuator monitors are ignored to prevent generation of
nuisance BLIN codes. In cold weather it is appropriate to re-attempt preflight BIT after running
exerciser mode. Exerciser mode should not be used as a method to clear BLIN codes in normal start-up
temperature conditions. BLIN codes cleared in this manner could be associated with hydraulic
contamination or sticking control valves which could appear again in flight with catastrophic results.
Repeatedly running exerciser mode in normal and hot weather environments may lead to hydraulic system overheat.
2.22.3.4.7 Running Preflight FCS Initiated BIT After Flight. A good (no codes) preflight FCS IBIT
on the previous flight is no assurance against latent failures on the next flight. Electronic components
have a propensity to fail on power application. Damage can occur during deck handling or maintenance
activity not associated with the flight controls. The only insurance is to run preflight FCS initiated BIT
prior to flight.
2.22.3.5 SMS Initiated BIT. Safeguards have been built into the weapon system mechanization to
allow SMS initiated BIT to be performed on the ground with weapons loaded and cartridges installed.
During initiated BIT, weapon release signals and associated circuitry are not exercised unless all of the
following interlocks are satisfied simultaneously: MASTER ARM switch to ARM, armament safety
override in override, weapon load codes on stores processor set to zero, and no weapon ID detected on
any weapon station. SMS initiated BIT should not be attempted until the above interlocks are in a safe
condition. The SMS initiated BIT should be successfully completed within 180 seconds of initiation.
2.22.3.6 INS Initiated BIT. To perform initiated BIT, the INS must be in the TEST mode and a
ground/carrier selection must be made to indicate where the BIT is being accomplished. When the
BIT/SELBIT/NAV/ALL, BIT/NAV/INS, or BIT/AUTO is actuated, a status message of GND/CV?
appears next to the INS legend in the status display area. At the same time, GND and CV button labels
appear along the bottom of the display. These options allow entry of where the initiated BIT is
performed, e.g., on the ground or on a carrier. A third option, INS LONG (INS long test), identifies if
the platform slew portion of the INS test is desired. The platform slew test, which adds an additional
26 minutes to the normal 12 minutes INS BIT time, is only performed when the INS exhibits degraded
navigation performance during a flight and normal BIT routines do not detect any malfunction. This
option should be selected prior to selecting the ground or carrier option.

1. Check parking brake set.
2. For ground initiated BIT insure waypoint zero is local latitude/longitude.
3. Select MENU/BIT/SELBIT/NAV or MENU/BIT/NAV/INS or MENU/BIT/AUTO or MENU/
BIT/NAV/ALL on the right DDI and TEST on the INS mode switch.
4. Select INS LONG (if required) and GND or CV on DDI, and start clock. At successful completion
of test BIT, display status message reads GO. Maximum time for INS initiated BIT is 12 minutes
and maximum time for INS initiated BIT and platform slew test is 45 minutes.
2.22.3.7 AUTO BIT. If the AUTO button is pressed, BIT are initiated in parallel for all equipment
turned ON and whose interlocks are satisfied. The test pattern associated with the DDI and HUD is
not displayed when the AUTO option is used. Approximately 2.5 minutes are required for all AUTO
BIT except FCS and INS.
1. Check power applied to all systems requiring BIT and check required interlocks in safe condition.
2. Select MENU/BIT/AUTO on DDI.
a. All systems read GO after required test period. GO indication is provided when system check
is complete and OK. Other messages may be displayed if malfunctions are detected.
3. If FCS test required, perform FCS Initiated BIT above while substituting the AUTO button for
the FCS button in the procedure. Insure the procedural warnings and notes are observed and that
the AUTO button and FCS BIT consent switch are held simultaneously to initiate test.
4. If INS test required, perform INS initiated BIT above while substituting the AUTO button for
the INS button in the INS Initiated BIT procedure.
2.22.3.8 Cockpit Displays Initiated BIT.
2.22.3.8.1 DDI/HUD Initiated BIT. Operator participation is required to detect failures and isolate
faults in the display equipment. The BIT/DISPLAYS/DDI-HUD option starts the MC generated test
patterns on the DDI and HUD immediately after each indicator BIT is concluded. The test pattern can
be compared on the 3 displays for similarity and individually for concentricity, intensity level, and
alphanumeric clarity. Options are tested by actuating all the buttons. A circle appears adjacent to the
button when the functional test is successfully completed.
With AMCD aircraft, IBIT takes approximately 20 to 90 seconds to complete (MC allows a
maximum of 200 seconds). During this interval, the displays cycle through a series of raster test
patterns (i.e., small square of raster, full screen of raster, small square again, and then a larger square
of raster). Immediately after the BIT for each display is concluded, the MC generated test pattern is
displayed on each of the displays. See figure 2-72. The STOP option on the test pattern terminates the
CRT test. The DDIs alternate color of the test pattern between green, red, and yellow.
Pressing DDI-HUD initiates BIT on two different equipment display groups. The following
procedure can be used to test one or both of the display groups by performing the appropriate parts
of the procedure.
1. Select BIT/DISPLAYS/DDI-HUD
A1-F18EA-NFM-000

a. Display commonality
b. Display concentricity
c. Proper intensity
d. Check right DDI pushbuttons (20) starting with the top left button on the horizontal row.

2.22.3.8.2 EFD Initiated BIT. The EFD test pattern is initiated by performing EFD BIT using
pushbutton sequence BIT/DISPLAYS/EFD and observing the test pattern display following the
completion of EFD BIT. The EFD test pattern may be observed using the following procedure.
1. Select BIT/DISPLAYS/EFD
2. EFD - observe test display
3. Select STOP or MENU to terminate test pattern
While the test pattern is displayed, selecting the MODE button or pulling the BINGO knob toggles
between the two test patterns displayed in figure 2-73. Rotating the BRT knob does not change display
intensity. Rotating the BINGO knob increments or decrements the number displayed in the lower
right corner from 1 to 12, depending on the rotation direction (clockwise or counterclockwise).
2.22.3.8.3 MPCD Initiated BIT. The MPCD receives information directly from the MC for display
and also processes the information provided for display on the UFCD. The MPCD test pattern is
initiated by doing MPCD BIT using pushbutton sequence BIT/DISPLAYS/MPCD and observing the
test pattern display following the completion of MPCD BIT. The MPCD test pattern may be observed
using the following procedure.
1. Select BIT/DISPLAYS/MPCD
2. MPCD and UFCD - observe test displays
3. Select STOP or MENU to terminate test pattern
The BIT format can be displayed on the MPCD or UFCD during DDI/HUD BIT and on the DDI
during MPCD BIT. On F/A-18F, the MPCD option initiates BIT on both the cockpit and rear cockpit
MPCD. During MPCD BIT the message MPCD IN TEST is displayed on both the MPCD and UFCD.
When IBIT is completed, the test pattern (figure 2-72) is displayed on both the MPCD and UFCD.
2.22.3.8.4 8 x 10 Display Initiated BIT. The 8 x 10 display executes initiated BIT by selecting
ACNTR on the Display BIT format. When selected, the 8 x 10 display completes IBIT and displays a
Figure 2-73. EFD Test Pattern
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-199 ORIGINAL
test pattern on both the 8 x 10 display and the aft UFCD. The 8 x 10 display test pattern is the same
as the DDI test pattern. The mission computer removes the IBIT command after 10 seconds to allow
viewing of the test pattern on both displays.
2.22.3.8.5 UFCD Initiated BIT. UFCD test patterns are initiated by selecting BIT/DISPLAYS/
UFCD and observing the test pattern display following the completion of UFCD BIT. The UFCD test
pattern (figure 2-74) is obtained using the following procedure.
1. Select BIT/DISPLAYS/UFCD.
2. UFCD - Observe test display
3. Select STOP or MENU to terminate test pattern.
When BIT is initiated, UFCD IN TEST is displayed until BIT is completed. On F/A-18F, selecting
UFCD initiates BIT on both cockpit and rear cockpit displays. The UFCD test pattern is not displayed
if IBIT is not initiated on the UFCD option.
2.22.3.8.6 Radar Altimeter Initiated BIT. If BIT is initiated during RADALT time-in, the status on
the BIT display is NOT READY. If the BIT is initiated after time-in is complete, the display is GO
(indicating the radar altimeter is operating correctly), RESTRT (the BIT was not completed within
the design time limits), or DEGD (a WRA fail signal exists).
2.22.3.8.7 STOP Button. The STOP button allows the aircrew to stop initiated BIT at any time. BIT
is also stopped by pressing MENU, although MENU is not available with the DSPL/EPI/EFD/UFCD
BIT test pattern displayed. When the STOP (or MENU) button is pressed, any test in progress stops
and the equipment returns to normal operation. Exceptions to this are the radar and SMS power-on
BIT and the COMM 1/2, D/L, and TACAN BIT. The radar and SMS power-on BIT cannot be
terminated and indicate SF TEST when the MC detects the system is in BIT without having been
commanded to do so. The same is true of the COMM 1/2, D/L, and TACAN equipment which does a
canned non-interruptable BIT sequence. The mission computer terminates initiated BIT for any
equipment that it determines has taken too long to complete the test.

2.22.3.9 Hydro-mechanical (HYDRO MECH) Initiated BIT. With SELBIT boxed on the top level
BIT format, selecting HYDRO MECH initiates ECS BIT if aircraft is WonW.
FADEC status is also provided on the HYDRO MECH display by L and R ENG A and B status
indications.
2.22.3.10 BLIN Codes. BIT Logic INspection (BLIN) codes are octal readouts identifying FCS
failures and can be read from the FCS status display. The following procedures may be used to display
and record BLIN codes. Channel 1 BLIN codes are displayed. Pressing the BLIN button displays the
next channel (1, 2, 3 and 4) BLIN codes.
1. On DDI - PRESS MENU-SUPT/FCS/BLIN
2. DDI BLIN codes - RECORD BY CHANNEL
3. Press BLIN button to view next channel BLIN codes
2.22.4 Non-Avionic BIT. Non-Avionic BIT is implemented in selected hydro-mechanical subsystems
primarily for the purpose of displaying subsystem status in the cockpit(s) (cautions and advisories)
and/or providing fault detection and fault isolation information for maintenance personnel. This status
data is provided to the status monitoring displays by the signal data computer which interfaces with
the following hydro-mechanical areas:
1. Engine/Secondary Power
2. Electrical
3. Hydraulics and landing/arresting gear
4. Fuel
5. Environmental control system and liquid cooling system
6. Controls/mechanisms/miscellaneous
The hydraulic system pressure cautions are interfaced directly by both mission computers, providing
redundancy for safety of flight.
2.22.4.1 Equipment Status Displays. NABIT cautions and advisories are displayed in the same
manner as avionics cautions and advisories.
2.22.5 Status Monitoring Backup. MC2 provides backup status monitoring if MC1 fails. It provides
an MC1 caution on the DDI indicating that MC1 has failed.
NOTE
With non-AMCD aircraft, if MC1 fails, all DDI cautions and advisories
are lost except MC1, HYD 1A, HYD 1B, HYD 2A, and HYD 2B. TAC
MENU loses the SA option and SUPT MENU displays only the HSI
option.

CONFIG legend.
2.22.6.2 CONFIG Display. The ID numbers of the current operational flight program (OFP) loads for
the radar, stores management system, CLC, INS, mission computers, communication system control,
flight control computer, FLIR, GPS, HMD, SDC, MU, LDT, DMC, MPCD, DDI, EW equipment,
DFIRS, FADECs, and ECS controller can be determined by selecting the configuration display (see
figure 2-75). The configuration display is selected by the following procedure:
1. Select BIT from the SUPT MENU.
2. Select CONFIG.
With the configuration display selected, the current ID numbers are displayed to the right of the
equipment acronym. Refer to figure 2-75 for an example.
2.22.6.2.1 MC CONFIG Caution. An MC CONFIG caution indicates MC1 and MC2 OFP loads are
incompatible.

A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-202 ORIGINAL
2.22.6.2.2 S/W CONFIG Caution. With the exception of JHMCS, a S/W CONFIG caution indicates
MC1 and MC2 OFP loads are not concurrent releases (incompatible) or an avionic equipment
processor OFP is incompatible with MC OFPs. The incompatible OFP(s) are indicated by a line drawn
through the OFP ident. If the MC OFPs are incompatible a line is drawn through both MC OFP idents.
For JHMCS, a S/W CONFIG caution and a line through the HMD S/W configuration line on the

the BuNo in the MC, or failure to load the initialization file into the EU.
2.22.6.2.3 OVRD Button. The override option allows the pilot to override the software configuration
logic when the software country ID codes do not agree with the aircraft country ID codes.
2.22.6.3 INS Terminal Data. INS terminal data can be obtained if at least one update has been
performed after flight with the parking brake on. Terminal data is displayed by selecting the following
options in sequence: MENU, BIT, MAINT, INS, and POST. Note the PER (performance error rate)
and navigation time on the FLIGHT 1, POST 1 display (see figure 2-76). Select the POST option again
and note the velocity on the FLIGHT 1, POST 2 display. Turn the INS mode selector knob to OFF.
With GPS operating, if the aircraft is flown with IAF selected, the performance error rate does not
include the time flown in the AINS mode.

2.23 JOINT HELMET MOUNTED CUEING SYSTEM (JHMCS)
The JHMCS allows the aircrew to target and employ existing short range missiles (SRMs) and High
Off-Boresight (HOBS) weapons, such as the AIM-9X, and cue the radar, and other sensors. When
using JHMCS to employ HOBS weapons, the aircrew can slave/acquire and shoot targets beyond the
gimbal limits of the aircraft radar and designate ground targets. The main display provides a
monocular 20° field of view that is visible in front of the pilot’s right eye.
The main components of the JHMCS include the helmet mounted displays, electronics unit,
HMD/AHMD off/brightness knobs, aft cockpit Boresight Reference Unit (BRU), cockpit units,
magnetic transmitter units, and seat position sensors in each cockpit. The JHMCS aircraft-integrated
components can be flown with or without the helmet system.
Increased weight and forward CG of the helmet will increase neck strain
during high or sustained g flight maneuvers.
NOTE
All aircrew shall receive simulator or dedicated ground training on
JHMCS helmet controls and displays prior to flight with JHMCS.
2.23.1 Helmet Mounted Display (HMD)/Aft Helmet Mounted Display (AHMD). Each HMD consists
of the helmet, Helmet Display Unit (HDU), Helmet-Vehicle Interface (HVI), and a universal connector
which connects the HDU to the helmet.
2.23.1.1 Helmet Display Unit (HDU). The HDU includes a CRT, Magnetic Receiver Unit (MRU),
camera, auto-brightness circuitry, uplook reticles, and visor. Aircrew can remove the HDU and
configure the helmet to accommodate the AN/AVS-9 night vision goggle system.
Ensure the HMD/AHMD OFF/BRT knob(s) are OFF before removing the HDU, and store the HDU
in the JHMCS stowage bag on the right bulkhead. See figure 2-78.
• To keep water out of the HDU on aircrew helmets and prevent the
possibility of electric shock, ensure the HDU cover is installed on the
helmet.
• To prevent damage to the HDU, do not expose the HDU to a
temperature exceeding 50°C (122°F) operationally or in storage.
2.23.1.2 Helmet-Vehicle Interface (HVI) Connectors. The HDU is connected to the aircraft by the
HVI, which consists of 3 connectors. These connectors are the Quick Disconnect Connector (QDC),
In-Line Release Connector (IRC), and Helmet Release Connector (HRC). The upper HVI is the
portion of the HVI from the helmet to the QDC. The lower HVI is the portion of the HVI below the
QDC that is installed in the aircraft.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-205 ORIGINAL
The upper HVI is routed under the survival vest (if worn) through the JHMCS bundle flue on the
torso harness. The QDC is seated in a Quick Mounting Bracket (QMB) attached to the lower left hand
leg strap of the torso harness. See figure 2-77.
The JHMCS upper HVI (UHVI) must be properly routed through the
JHMCS bundle flue under the survival vest and the QDC secured in the
QMB to ensure that no entanglement exists with the oxygen hose.
Misrouting of the JHMCS UHVI may allow the QDC to rub against the
oxygen hose disconnect causing unintentional oxygen/communications
disconnect in-flight.
The QDC is the primary disconnect for ejection, and both normal and emergency ground egress. The
QDC can be manually disconnected for normal egress by pushing a button on top of the QDC and
separating the top half. During an ejection or emergency egress the QDC is disconnected via an aircraft
mounted lanyard when a force of 15 to 25 pounds is applied. When the QDC is not connected, the
aircraft QDC should be properly stowed in its receptacle. When the QDC is not properly connected and
the system is on, an HMD/AHMD advisory is generated.
The JHMCS QDC must be properly attached to the aircrew torso harness
QDC mounting bracket to avoid possible death or severe injury during
ejection.
• Low voltage is present on the exposed QDC pins when the HMD/
AHMD OFF/BRT knob(s) are not in OFF. To prevent a minor
electrical shock from contact with exposed pins, ensure the HMD/
AHMD OFF/BRT knobs are OFF whenever the QDC is disconnected
or connected.
• To prevent damage to the QDC and aircraft components, ensure the
aircraft QDC is properly stowed in its receptacle when not mated to
the aircrew’s QDC.
NOTE
Ambient cockpit temperatures at or below 0°C (32°F) may cause
inadvertent HMD/AHMD advisories during preflight. Warming of the
QDC and quick mount bracket should remove the failure indication if
temperature is the cause.
The IRC is a back-up disconnect which functions in the event of QDC failure. The IRC is attached
to the left aft console and requires a force of 80 to 120 pounds to disconnect.
The HRC allows the cable to disconnect should the helmet be lost during ejection. The HRC
connects to the left shoulder harness and requires a force of 80 to 120 pounds to disconnect.

2.23.2 Electronics Unit (EU). The EU contains the main system CPU, LOS module, graphics
processor/display drive (one for each HMD), and low voltage power supply. The CPU controls system
bus interfacing, display list generation, BIT, and other system functions. The LOS module calculates
helmet LOS while the graphics processor/display drive processes the display list and generates the
helmet display. The MC interfaces with the EU via the MUX bus. It is located in the rear cockpit.
2.23.3 Cockpit Unit (CU). The CU contains the system high voltage power supply for helmet
displays. On the F/A-18E, it is located in the upper equipment bay, and on the F/A-18F, both CUs are
located in the aft crew station.
2.23.4 Magnetic Transmitter Unit (MTU). The MTU is used to generate a magnetic field used to
determine HMD/AHMD position/orientation by the HMD MRU receiving the magnetic field and then
sending the received signal to the EU. One MTU per cockpit is mounted on the canopy frame aft of the
pilot/WSO’s left shoulder.
The MTU is energized when the HMD/AHMD is turned on. Warm-up time for the MTU is 15 to 20
minutes. System accuracy may drift up to 0.5° if the HMD/AHMD is aligned before MTU warm-up
is completed. An additional 5 to 10 minutes should be added to the MTU warm-up time if operating
in extremely cold temperatures (e.g., -40°C).
NOTE
To maintain system accuracy, run initial HMD/AHMD alignment, or
an additional HMD/AHMD alignment, after system is warmed-up.
2.23.5 Boresight Reference Unit (BRU). On the F/A-18F, the BRU is located on top of the
instrument blast shield and dust cover. An alignment cross is provided inside the BRU to permit coarse
and fine alignment of the AHMD to the aircraft reference. See figure 2-79.
2.23.6 Seat Position Sensor (SPS). The SPS is a linear potentiometer which indicates ejection seat
height to the JHMCS. It is mounted to the aft right side of the ejection seat. There is one SPS for each
ejection seat. This seat position information allows the JHMCS to compensate for disruption of the
magnetic field in the cockpit as the metal in the seat changes position when the seat is raised or
lowered.
2.23.7 HMD/AHMD OFF/BRT Knobs. The front cockpit HMD OFF/BRT knob is located on the spin
recovery panel. This knob removes and applies power to the HMD, and adjusts HMD display
brightness. See figure 2-78.
A BRU/HMD OFF/BRT stacked knob, located on the aft cockpit INTR LT control panel, removes
and applies power to the BRU/AHMD, and adjusts BRU/AHMD display brightness. See figure 2-78.
2.23.8 HUD Video Record Panel. A switch has been added to the HUD video record panel so that
HMD or LDDI can be selected while the other switch is used to select HUD or RDDI for video
recording.
2.23.9 Cautions/Advisories. When the BuNo in the Magnetic Compensation Data file does not
match the BuNo in the MC, or if the MC fails to download the initialization file to the EU, the MC sets
the SW CONFIG caution and displays a line through the HMD S/W configuration line on the
configuration display. An HMD/AHMD advisory is reported if the QDC is not properly secured to
Quick Mounting Bracket (QMB) or is disconnected, the HDU is not properly connected, or the coarse
alignment is invalid or has not been performed.

2.23.10 Configuration Check. When the JHMCS system is turned on, the MC provides the EU with
the aircraft make, model, and tail number.
2.23.11 Built-In Test (BIT). The JHMCS BIT system includes automated start-up BIT (SBIT) and
initiated BIT (IBIT), and displays a BIT status message. See figure 2-80 for the DISPLAYS BIT
sublevel display.
2.23.11.1 Start-up BIT (SBIT). When the HMD system is turned on, SBIT starts automatically and
the internal software is loaded in the EU. SBIT cannot be stopped until it is completed. PBIT GO or
DEGD, as appropriate, is displayed when SBIT is completed.
2.23.11.2 Initiated BIT (IBIT). IBIT is performed when the HMD (PB 11) option is selected in either
cockpit on the DISPLAYS BIT sublevel display. ENTERING IBIT flashes on both HMDs, and an
initiated BIT is performed on both helmets. When IBIT is complete, a series of four test patterns,
which are automatically changed each second, are displayed on the HMD/AHMD. See figure 2-81. The
test patterns are displayed until the STOP (PB 10) option is selected. If the ALL (PB 6) option is
selected, IBIT and HMD test patterns are performed.

PBIT GO EU responded with no failures prior to performing IBIT
2.23.11.4 BIT Recording On The Memory Unit. The MC records any failure or degrade reported by
the EU to the memory unit for fault reporting and isolation.
2.23.11.5 Overheat Condition. The system has the capability to detect an equipment overheat
condition. When an overheat condition is detected the system is automatically shut down to prevent
equipment damage.
2.23.12 JHMCS Alignment. The JHMCS must be boresighted (aligned) with the aircraft prior to
every flight. Selecting the ALIGN (PB 20) option on the HMD format boxes ALIGN, selects coarse
alignment mode, and displays the FINE (PB 1) alignment option after the coarse align function is
complete. See figure 2-82.
The forward and aft helmets are aligned independently. Selecting the ALIGN (PB 20) option on the
HMD format from the aft cockpit initiates aft HMD align. When in aft coarse or fine align mode, the
MC assigns the right hand controller undesignate and Designator Control (DC) switches to the HMD.
Both forward and aft HMD alignments function identically with the exception that the aft helmet is
aligned to the BRU mounted on top of the instrument blast shield and dust cover.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-213 ORIGINAL
2.23.12.1 Coarse Alignment. An alignment cross is displayed on the HUD/BRU and on the
HMD/AHMD. See figure 2-82. The pilot moves the HMD to superimpose the alignment cross on the
HMD over the alignment cross on the HUD. Once aligned, the cage/uncage switch is pressed and held
until ALIGN OK is displayed on the HMD. When coarse alignment is complete, fine alignment is
automatically selected. Fine alignment (PB 1) can also be manually selected.
The WSO moves the HMD to superimpose the alignment cross on the HMD over the alignment
cross on the BRU, figure 2-82, sheet 2. Once aligned, the undesignate switch on the right hand
controller is pressed and held until ALIGN OK is displayed on the HMD. When coarse alignment is
complete, fine alignment is automatically selected. Fine alignment (PB 1) can also be manually
selected.
2.23.12.2 Fine Alignment. When the FINE (PB 1) option is boxed, an alignment cross is displayed
in the HUD, and two alignment crosses are displayed on the HMD in the vicinity of the HUD
alignment cross. See figure 2-83. The display indicates which axis is being aligned. If azimuth and
elevation is indicated (FA DXDY), the pilot moves the TDC either left or right to align in azimuth, up
or down to align in elevation. The pilot presses and releases the cage/uncage switch when satisfied with
the quality of the azimuth and elevation alignment. This causes the display to toggle to roll alignment
mode. With the roll axis indicated (FA DROLL), TDC inputs to the left or right are used to rotate the
HMD alignment symbols to align with the HUD alignment cross. The pilot presses and releases the
cage/uncage switch when satisfied with the quality of the roll alignment. Pressing and releasing the
cage/uncage switch continues to toggle between these two modes until the pilot deselects FINE to
return to coarse alignment or exits alignment.
Upon entering fine alignment, automatically, or if commanded by the WSO selecting the FINE
option, the EU indicates which axis is being aligned. If the azimuth and elevation axis is indicated, the
WSO uses the DC to move the crosses up/down and left/right to align with the cross displayed on the
BRU, (figure 2-83 sheet 2). When satisfied with the alignment, the WSO presses and releases the
undesignate switch on right hand controller at which time the EU automatically switches to roll
alignment. The WSO uses the DC to rotate the cross so that it aligns with the cross displayed on the
BRU. When satisfied with the quality of the alignment the WSO presses and releases undesignate
switch on right hand controller.
2.23.12.3 Alignment Exit. Alignment is exited whenever ALIGN is deselected (unboxed), an A/A
weapon is selected, MENU is selected, TDC priority is reassigned, ACM mode is selected, or the master
mode is changed. This removes the alignment cross from the HUD, removes the FINE option, unboxes
ALIGN, and returns the cage/uncage function to the previously assigned system.
2.23.12.4 Alignment Verification. When the HMD is in normal mode a cross is displayed on the
HUD at the reported HMD LOS. See figure 2-84. If the reported HMD LOS is outside the HUD FOV,
the cross flashes at the HUD FOV limit.
2.23.13 HMD/AHMD Symbology
2.23.13.1 HUD Symbology Replicated on the HMD. The HMD layout essentially replicates the
HUD layout. Window locations, format, and occlusion level on the HMD are as identical to the HUD
locations, format, and occlusion level as practical.
2.23.13.2 HUD Symbology Not Replicated on the HMD. Some of the symbology on the HUD is
either not required on the HMD or would be disorienting if the information was presented. The
following paragraphs describe the items on the HUD which are not replicated on the HMD.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-2-214 ORIGINAL
2.23.13.2.1 Aircraft Attitude Data. Some HUD data only provides the pilot usable information
when presented along the aircraft boresight. HMD data is not always presented along the aircraft
boresight. For this reason, the aircraft pitch ladder, horizon bar, water line indicator, and velocity
vector are not displayed on the HMD/AHMD.
The HMD/AHMD does not provide adequate attitude information and
should not be used as a primary flight instrument.
2.23.13.2.2 Ground Proximity Warning System. In addition to aircraft attitude data, the HMD/
AHMD does not replicate the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) arrow. However, when the
GPWS is activated, ALTITUDE is displayed in the HARM window of the HMD/AHMD.
2.23.13.2.3 Landing Aid Symbology. Landing aid symbology is not displayed on the HUD.
2.23.14 Navigation Master Mode. If present, the MC displays the A/A L&S with the TD box and its
associated TLL, or the A/G designation with the TD diamond and its associated TLL. However, if both
the A/A L&S and the A/G designation are present, only the A/A L&S TLL is displayed.
2.23.14.1 NAV Master Mode TDC Priority. When in NAV master mode, the TDC can be assigned
priority to the HMD by pressing the castle switch forward. This is indicated by an open aiming cross
with a dot in the center being displayed. If TDC priority is removed from the HMD, the dot is removed
from the center of the aiming cross.

2.23.15 Mission Computer Failure. With non-AMCD aircraft, in the event of an MC1 failure, MC2
provides back-up symbology for the HMD. MC2, at a minimum, provides airspeed, altitude, selected
A/A weapon and count, and the L&S and AIM-9 LOS. MC2 continues to slave the radar to the HMD
LOS when in HACQ mode. MC2 also continues to slave the AIM-9 to the HMD LOS when the AIM-9
is selected. Activation of the uplook reticles are also maintained during back-up.
With non-AMCD aircraft, in the event of an MC2 failure, MC1 provides back-up symbology for the
HMD. MC1, at a minimum, provides airspeed, altitude, selected A/A weapon and count. Slaving of the
radar and AIM-9 is suspended.
With AMCD aircraft, the HMD is not supported in the MC backup mode. If either MC fails, no
symbology is displayed on either helmet and the remaining operating MC functions as if no helmets are
installed.
2.23.16 Electronic Unit Failure. In the event of an EU failure which does not allow any symbology
to be displayed on the HMD, the MC provides the radar boresight symbol and AIM-9 FOV symbol on
the HUD. If the LOS is still valid, the MC continues to slave the radar or AIM-9 to the HMD LOS. If
the LOS is invalid, the MC reverts to the current no-helmet mechanization for slaving weapons,
sensors, and HOTAS.

2.23.17 Helmet Tracker Failure. If the EU reports that the helmet tracker is failed, or the helmet
LOS is no longer valid, the MC discontinues slaving sensors and weapons to the HMD LOS. The MC
replaces aircraft boresight for the helmet LOS to the radar and AIM-9, and deselects slaving for the
A/A FLIR. Additionally, the MC removes any item from the HMD which is tied to the HMD LOS. The
radar boresight and AIM-9 FOV symbol are restored to the HUD. The MC also restores VACQ mode
and the HOTAS function to access the VACQ function. The MC continues to display information on
the HMD which is not tied to the HMD LOS.
2.23.18 Helmet Not Installed. When the MC determines that the HMD is not on, or the EU is not
responding to the MC via the mux bus, the MC reverts to the current no-helmet mechanization for
slaving weapons, sensors, HOTAS, and HUD display.

Figure 4-4. Gross Weight and Lateral Weight Asymmetry Limitations
NOTE
• Field landing/FCLP/T&G, and Carrier Landing/Barricade limits are
ground loads limits and apply to touchdown only. All in-flight phases,
including approach to landing must meet the in-flight lateral asymmetry restrictions in figure 4-4.
• Catapult limits are derived from both flying quality limits and ground
load limits. Ensure neither limit is exceeded during catapult launch.
4.1.4.1 Lateral Weight Asymmetry Calculations. Field takeoff and in-flight lateral asymmetry is
calculated by using the weight of asymmetric stores on stations 2 thru 10. Field landing events lateral
asymmetry is calculated by using the weight of asymmetric stores on stations 1 thru 11. For catapult
operations, lateral weight asymmetry is calculated for stations 1 thru 11 and stations 2 thru 10. For
asymmetric catapult launch endspeed (asymmetric weight board designation) and catapult launch
lateral trim calculations, use the asymmetry of stations 2 thru 10. For field takeoff and in-flight
calculations, the weight of asymmetric internal wing fuel can be ignored unless the FUEL XFER
caution is displayed due to asymmetric internal wing fuel. In addition, for catapult and landing events,
all asymmetric internal wing fuel weight (regardless of FUEL XFER caution) is included due to
landing gear structural load limitations.
With MC OFP H3E AND UP, lateral weight asymmetry is calculated by the MC and displayed on
the CHKLST page. Two values are displayed, FLY and LAND, and indicate thousands of ft-lb. The
values are displayed on the heavy side of the aircraft and it is possible that one value will be displayed
on one side of the aircraft and the other value on the other side. The FLY value is calculated using the
weight of asymmetric stores on stations 2 thru 10. The LAND value is calculated using the weight of
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
I-4-3 ORIGINAL
asymmetric stores on stations 1 thru 11. Both values include internal wing fuel imbalances regardless
of FUEL XFER caution status. The values will flash when one fuel quantity is invalid or one weapon
station indicates HUNG and the values will be removed if more than one fuel quantity is invalid,
and/or weapon station indicates HUNG.
The FLY value is used for field takeoff, catapult, and in flight. The LAND value is used for landing
events or catapult. For asymmetric catapult launch endspeed (asymmetric weight board designation)
and catapult launch trim calculations, use the FLY value. In flight, it is possible for the FLY value to
exceed the value in figure 4-4 due to small fuel imbalances. A manual lateral asymmetry calculation
should be performed in accordance with figure 4-4. If AOA TONE caution is present and/or lateral
weight asymmetry calculations are flashing, calculate aircraft lateral asymmetry manually.
NOTE
• If a FUEL XFER caution is displayed and the internal wing tanks are
unbalanced, the weight of asymmetric internal wing fuel must be used
in calculating total weight asymmetry in all phases of flight. Completely split internal wing tanks (one full and one empty) have the
potential of reaching 14,000 ft-lb of lateral weight asymmetry.
• The following is a rule of thumb for calculating internal wing tank
asymmetry: pounds of fuel split x 10 (e.g., a 200 pound fuel split
equates to approximately 2,000 ft-lb of asymmetry).
• With a symmetrically loaded aircraft, release of any single store, with
the exception of a full midboard 480 gallon tank, will not exceed the
lateral weight asymmetry limitations. Release of dissimilar stores in
the normal SMS release sequence may exceed the lateral weight
asymmetry limitation.
Figure 4-5. Asymmetric Stores Limitations
* The weight of an asymmetric missile or pod on stations 1 or 11 is not to be included in asymmetry
limitations calculations for field takeoff or in flight, but is included in landing events lateral weight
asymmetry calculations. For catapult operations, lateral asymmetry must be calculated for stations 1
thru 11 and stations 2 thru 10.

Notes:
(1) Rolling maneuvers up to abrupt, full stick (full stick in less than 1 second) are authorized within the
AOA and acceleration limitations specified in figure 4-7.
(2) In ‘‘Single axis inputs only’’ regions, avoid rolling or yawing the aircraft while changing longitudinal stick
position. It is acceptable to pull, stop, then roll or to pull and counter any roll-off induced by the heavy
wing under g.
(3) With MC OFP H3E AND UP, AOA tone in flaps AUTO is based on the limits in this figure and
computed lateral asymmetry. The tone indicates that the AOA lateral asymmetry limit has been
exceeded. AOA shall be reduced to stay within the limits of figure 4-6.

4.1.6 Acceleration Limitations. With flaps in AUTO, the acceleration limitations for the basic
aircraft (with or without empty pylons) in smooth air with the landing gear retracted are shown in
figure 4-7. In moderate turbulence, reduce deliberate accelerations 2g below that shown in figure 4-7
to minimize the potential of an aircraft over-g.
Acceleration limits during landing gear extension/retraction, or with landing gear extended, are 0.0
to +2.0g (symmetrical) and +0.5 to +1.5g (rolling).

NOTES
1. At any specific gross weight, the G-limiter will attempt to limit command g to the levels shown
above, up to 57,405 lb GW. Above 57,405 lb GW, the G-limiter is fixed at +5.5.
2. Overshoots up to +0.5g or -0.2g do not constitute an over-g.
3. Above 57,405 lb, an over-g will occur if the pilot solely relies on the G-limiter.
4. The aircraft structural carriage g envelope is based on the product of the maximum normal
acceleration limits of +7.5g and -3.0g at a weight of 42,097 lb. As aircraft gross weight increases
above 42,097 lb, Nz must be decreased so that the maximum NzW allowable is not exceeded. Refer
to sheet 3 for an example of NzW correction for these calculations. Nz limits less than +2.0 and -2.0
need not be corrected for NzW.
5. See External Stores Limitations, A1-F18EA-TAC-020 (NWP 3-22.5-F/A18E/F VOL. IV) for
additional acceleration limitations which may apply when carrying stores. Unless otherwise noted,
Nz store limitations are based on an aircraft gross weight of 42,097 lb. As aircraft gross weight
increases above 42,097 lb, Nz must be decreased so that the maximum NzW allowable is not
exceeded. Refer to sheet 3 for an example of NzW correction for these calculations. Over-g
protection is not provided by the G-limiter for additional Nz restrictions due to store carriage.
Over-g due to store limitations will not trigger an over-g MSP code but aircraft over stress may
result. Additional store restrictions should be closely monitored by aircrew. Nz limits between +2.0
and -2.0 need not be corrected for NzW.

NOTES
1. At any specific gross weight, the G-limiter will attempt to limit command positive g to the levels
shown above, up to 57,405 lb GW with lateral stick inputs. Above 57,405 lb GW, the G-limiter is
fixed at +4.4. For negative rolling maneuvers beyond -1 g, the G-limiter will not reduce command
g in response to lateral stick input. Negative load factor when rolling shall be closely monitored.
2. G-limiter overshoots up to +0.5g or -0.2g do not constitute an over-g.
3. Above 57,405 lb, an over-g will occur if the pilot solely relies on the G-limiter.
4. The aircraft structural carriage g envelope is based on the product of the maximum normal
acceleration limits of +7.5g and -3.0g at a weight of 42,097 lb. As aircraft gross weight increases
above 42,097 lb Nz must be decreased so that the maximum NzW allowable is not exceeded. Refer
to sheet 3 for an example of NzW correction for these calculations. Nz limits between +2.0 and -2.0
need not be corrected for NzW.
5. See External Stores Limitations, A1-F18EA-TAC-020 (NWP 3-22.5-F/A18E/F VOL. IV) for
additional acceleration limitations which may apply when carrying stores. Unless otherwise noted,
Nz store limitations are based on an aircraft gross weight of 42,097 lb. As aircraft gross weight
increases above 42,097 lb, Nz must be decreased so that the maximum NzW allowable is not
exceeded. Refer to sheet 3 for an example of NzW correction for these calculations. Over-g
protection is not provided by the G-limiter for additional Nz restrictions due to store carriage.
Over-g due to store limitations will not trigger an over-g MSP code but aircraft over stress may
result. Additional store restrictions should be closely monitored by aircrew. Nz limits between +2.0

i. Baro altitude displayed with an ″X″
10. In-flight Memory Inspect (MI) of FCC (UNIT 14 or 15) addresses (ADDR) greater than six
digits long.
In-flight Memory Inspect (MI) of FCC (UNIT 14 or 15) addresses
(ADDR) greater than six digits long may cause all four FCC channels to
shut down which will result in loss of aircraft control.
Departure/Spin -
1. Zero airspeed tailslides.
2. Intentional departures/spins.
3. Yaw rates over 40° second (yaw tone).
4. Holding roll inputs (lateral stick or rudder pedal) past 360° of bank angle change.

4.4 AESA RADAR LIMITATIONS
Flight testing of the AN/APG-79 AESA radar has shown that this system can interfere with, and
significantly degrade the performance of, various precision approach systems including PAR and
ACLS. Aircrew operating AN/APG-79 AESA equipped aircraft shall be aware that directing
AN/APG-79 AESA transmissions toward landing facilities (ship or shore) may cause strong electromagnetic interference (EMI) affecting the safety of aircraft on approach. To the maximum extent
possible, aircrew shall avoid directing AN/APG-79 AESA radar transmissions towards facilities with an
operating active PAR or ACLS (shipboard or shore-based). Unless specifically authorized for
operational necessity or required for safety of flight, aircrew should cease AN/APG-79 AESA radar
transmissions whenever operating within 10 nm of PAR and ACLS facilities during IMC/Case III
conditions.
• AN/APG-79 AESA radar transmissions specifically directed towards
an operating PAR or ACLS within 10 nm have caused strong electromagnetic interference (EMI) with these radar-based systems and
caused intermittent, unannunciated anomalies that resulted in erroneous azimuth/glideslope commands being sent to aircraft on precision
approach, increasing the risk of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT).
Proper flight instrument crosscheck using all available means
(TACAN, DME, and RADALT) is essential for all aircraft during PAR
and ACLS approaches to detect abnormal precision approach parameters.
• The AGR mode of the AN/APG-79 AESA radar was observed to cause
some of the highest levels of EMI on affected PAR and ACLS systems.
Ensure the AN/APG-79 radar is in SIL, STBY, or OFF prior to
selection of TDC to the HUD in order to enable the steering dot in the
center of the velocity vector (which commands AGR).
• AN/APG-79 AESA radar transmissions within 10 nm directed towards
civil airfields operating ASDE-X ground traffic management systems
have caused EMI. ASDE-X is an FAA-designed, radar-based system
designed to reduce runway incursions by tracking departing, arriving,
and taxiing aircraft plus ground vehicles at major civilian airfields.
AN/APG-79 AESA-generated EMI results in ASDE-X system shutdown, increasing the risk to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles of
unintentional ground or runway incursion.
NOTE
AN/APG-79 AESA radar does not interfere with SPN-41 ICLS systems
or non-precision radar approach systems (ASR). AN/APG-79 has not
been tested against other civil systems (ILS).
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
ORIGINAL W/IC 33
I-4-20
NOTE
• Adverse EMI effects from AN/APG-79 AESA equipped aircraft acting
as overhead/recovery tankers (not on approach) have been observed
during SPN-42 and SPN-46 ACLS testing.
• The SPN-42 (shore-based ACLS) and SPN-46 (shipboard ACLS) have
shown degraded lock-on and command guidance anomalies due to
EMI interference from AN/APG-79 AESA radar transmisisons. For
the SPN-46 system, these anomalies are more severe and more
probable with the Block 1 Upgrade to the SPN-46 system.
• Through 2011, the FAA has stated the ASDE-X system will be fielded
at the following locations: KATL, KBDL, KBOS, KBWI, KCLT,
KDCA, KDEN, KDFW, KEWR, KFLL, KHIK, KHOU, KIAD,

Shore-Based Procedures
NOTE
• F/A-18F WSO responsibilities are italicized.
• For F/A-18F crew coordination specifics, including individual aircrew
responsibilities and ICS communications, refer to Chapter 29, Crew
Coordination Standards.
7.1 PREFLIGHT CHECKS
7.1.1 In Maintenance Control. The A-sheet must be checked for aircraft status, configuration,
armament loading, and servicing prior to manning the aircraft. Review the aircraft discrepancy book
(ADB) for (1) all outstanding discrepancies and (2) at least the last 10 flights worth of discrepancies
and corrective action. Weight and balance clearance is the responsibility of the Maintenance
Department.
7.1.2 Inspection of RCS Reduction Features. The most critical RCS reduction features/treatments
include (1) EMIS III radar bulkhead shields, (2) canopy and windshield coatings, (3) engine inlet
devices, and (4) outer moldline mismatch/gap control. To ensure that the survivability characteristics
of the aircraft are retained, attention should be focused on the following areas:
1. On missions where the full RCS reduction potential of the aircraft is desired (typically wartime
environment only), ensure the twelve missionized EMIS III radar bulkhead shields are installed.
Additionally, ensure all SUU-79 pylons are fitted with their LO hardware (CAD access covers and
four bolt fairings).
2. Typically, if minor damage to canopy or windshield coatings is visually acceptable for flight, the
RCS reduction potential of the coatings should be retained.
3. Typically, if minor damage to the inlet lip/duct RAM coatings or to the inlet device are acceptable
from a FOD standpoint, the RCS reduction potential of the coatings/device should be retained.
4. Mismatches and gaps in the outer moldline of the aircraft can substantially reduce RCS reduction
potential. Care should be taken to note and repair damage to RAM coatings and FIP seals,
particularly around frequently opened panels. Doors and panels should be flush with the surrounding structure and gaps should be filled. In general, a rule of thumb for an acceptable amount of
panel/structure mismatch is no greater than the thickness of a PCL cover. With mismatches greater
than that width, some RCS reduction potential is lost. The most critical gaps are those aligned
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft (e.g., vertical gaps between side panels and 3-9
line gaps between underside panels). Gaps and mismatches that run along the longitudinal axis of
the aircraft are less critical.
In general, at least 75% of the perimeter of every door should exhibit good FIP seal integrity (e.g.,
sealed and flush). RAM coating damage should not exceed 25% of the total RAM area in any particular
location (e.g., around flap hinges or main landing gear door edges). Multi-layer RAM patches forward
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-1 ORIGINAL
of the inlet should show no sign of disbonding or peeling. All conductive tape, the windshield aft arch
termination strip, NLG blade seals, canopy and wing conductive bulb seals, and TEF/rudder boots
should be fully bonded, with no loose or peeling corners or edges. It is normally acceptable to trim loose
materials that are noticed just prior to flight.
7.1.3 Exterior Inspection. The exterior inspection (figure 7-1) is divided into 20 areas, beginning at
the left forward fuselage and continuing clockwise around the aircraft. Check doors secure and be alert
for loose fasteners, cracks, dents, leaks, and other general discrepancies. Close inspection shall be given
to the left and right nose sections for moldline defects (bends, dents, dings, cracking or blistering of
exterior coatings, or other surface discrepancies) that will affect the pitot-static system and RVSM
capability.

7.2 ENGINE START
A self-contained (battery/APU) start is the primary method for starting the engines. The aircraft
also has provisions for starting on external power, external air, or opposite engine bleed air (crossbleed)
for circumstances when that may be appropriate (e.g., alert launch, low battery, maintenance, engine
restart after APU shutdown, etc.). As such, the steps for a ″normal″ battery/APU start are numbered
below, while steps for alternate starting sources are lettered.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-18 ORIGINAL
With an external power start, all electrical systems are operative. With a battery start, power is
available to operate the APU and engine fire warning systems, the caution lights panel, the intercom
system between the aircrew and the ground crew, the cockpit utility light, and the EFD backup display.
The right engine is normally started first in order to provide normal hydraulics to the brakes. During
first engine battery start, the EFD RPM indication typically jumps from 0 to 5 or 10%, and light-off
is indicated by TEMP rising from a minimum reported value of approximately 190°C. When the
corresponding generator comes online (approximately 60%N2 rpm), the engine crank switch returns to
OFF. After both generators are online, the APU will run for 1 minute and then shut down
automatically.
• To prevent engine damage during start, if an engine was not idled
(75% N2 rpm or less) for 5 minutes prior to shutdown and a restart
must be made between 15 minutes and 4 hours after shutdown, the
engine must be motored for 1 minute at 29%N2 or greater before
restart.
• To prevent vibration and damage to compressor blades, do not allow
N2 rpm to dwell between 26 to 29%during engine motoring.
7.2.1 Intercockpit Communications (F/A-18F). The following Challenge/Response voice communications are mandatory:
Challenge Response
Pilot - ICS check
Pilot - Fire warning
Pilot - Starting APU left/right
WSO - Good waypoint zero
Pilot - Canopy
WSO - Loud and clear
WSO - Roger (Optional)
WSO - Roger (Optional)
Pilot - Roger (Optional)

7.2.2 Engine Start Checks. In the F/A-18F, the WSO must monitor pilot procedures, EFD indications, and plane captain signals to ensure maximum safety during engine start.
1. BATT switch - ON
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-19 ORIGINAL
2. Battery gauge - CHECK
NOTE
Nominal voltage for a ″good″ battery should be 23 to 24 vdc. Minimum
battery voltage is that which provides a successful engine start (i.e.,
APU remains online and the EFD remains powered to provide
indications of RPM and TEMP). EFD blanking and/or uncommanded
APU shutdown should be anticipated with a battery voltage at or
below approximately 18 vdc. If a weak battery results in an
unsuccessful engine start attempt, the battery should be charged or
replaced prior to takeoff, since the battery provides the last source of
electrical redundancy for the FCCs.

5. FIRE warning test - PERFORM
a. FIRE test switch - TEST A (hold until all lights and aural warnings indicate test has been
successfully passed)
b. FIRE test switch - NORM (pause 7 seconds or cycle BATT switch for system reset)
c. FIRE test switch - TEST B (hold until all lights and aural warnings indicate test has been
successfully passed)
NOTE
During a successful FIRE warning test, ALL of the following lights
should illuminate in each TEST position: both FIRE lights (all 4
bulbs), the APU FIRE light (all 4 bulbs), and both L and R BLEED
warning lights. Additionally, the following voice aural warnings should
be heard in order: ″Engine fire left, engine fire right, APU fire, bleed
air left, bleed air right″ (each repeated twice).
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-20 ORIGINAL
NOTE
• A complete FIRE warning test is performed in each TEST position
because it is difficult to recognize a single unlit bulb in a FIRE light.
Since an aural warning does not annunciate if any of the FIRE or
BALD loops are bad, lack of an aural warning is the best cue to the
aircrew of a test failure.
• Failure to pause in NORM for at least 3 seconds between TEST A and
TEST B results in a false BALD failure MSP code.
6. Forward MPCD and UFCD knobs - ON
NOTE
Forward MPCD and UFCD need to be turned on to display the
backup HUD format and L/R ATS cautions.
If APU start -
7. APU ACC caution light - VERIFY OFF
8. APU switch - ON (READY light within 30 seconds)
To prevent an APU running engagement and to prevent APU exhaust
torching, a minimum of 2 minutes must elapse between APU shutdown
and another APU start.
NOTE
If an APU fire or overheat condition is detected on the ground, the
APU fire extinguishing system will automatically shutdown the APU
and, after 10 seconds, will discharge the extinguisher bottle.
If external air start -
a. BLEED AIR knob - OFF
All starts -
Regardless of the engine start air source utilized, the corresponding GEN
switch should be ON, as the generator provides primary overspeed cutout
protection for the ATS.

10. Right throttle - IDLE (10% N2 minimum. Oil pressure should be a minimum of 10 psi within 30
seconds. Maximum transient EGT during start is 871°C).
NOTE
During ground starts only, the FADEC will automatically cut back fuel
flow to prevent EGT from exceeding 815°C. If required, fuel flow will
be reduced to the point of engine flameout. While this mechanization
is provided to prevent engine damage due to an overtemp, the aircrew
should not rely on it to prevent a hot start.
11. CFIT voice warnings - CHECK (OFP 18E: ″ROLL-LEFT...ROLL-LEFT″) (OFP 13E: ″ROLLOUT...ROLL-OUT″)
NOTE
MC1 does an ACI configuration check after the generator comes on
line during a cold start power-up by commanding the above voice
warning. If the ACI does not contain the appropriate software, the
″ROLL-LEFT...ROLL-LEFT″ voice warning is not heard and the MC1
will assume an incompatible ACI is installed in the aircraft, GPWS/
TAWS voice warnings are not available and only the recovery arrow
will be displayed during a CFIT condition.
12. Battery gauge - VERIFY 28 vdc
NOTE
If the battery gauge fails to reach approximately 28 vdc with one
generator online, a battery charger malfunction has occurred which
requires maintenance action prior to flight.
13. L(R) DDI, HUD, and MPCD knobs - ON (both cockpits)
During a battery start of the right engine, recognition of a R ATS caution
will be delayed until the displays are turned on. Once the displays are
powered, verify that the R ATS caution is not set.

A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-24 ORIGINAL
Flight with BLIN codes could result in a FCS failure and aircraft loss.
Pressing the FCS RESET button simultaneously with the paddle switch
does not correct BIT detected FCS failures; it simply clears the BLIN
codes from the FCS display. FCS IBIT must be re-run after clearing
BLIN codes to ensure that previously detected failures no longer exist. If
BLIN codes remain following IBIT, maintenance action is required to
identify and correct failures in the FCS.
NOTE
• With the wings folded, both ailerons are X’d out, but no aileron BLIN
codes should be displayed. Even with wings folded, there are aileron
functions tested that may reveal FCS failures via valid BLIN codes.
• For FCS IBIT to start, the FCS BIT consent switch must be held for
at least 2 seconds. If not held for the required time, FCS A and FCS B
will indicate RESTRT on the BIT status line. If RESTRT is displayed, select STOP on the FCS-MC sublevel display and then repeat
the initiation procedure.
• The FCS will not enter IBIT if the throttles are above 14° THA or
NWS is engaged.
• Do not operate any FCS related switches or move the stick or rudder
pedals while FCS IBIT is running, as this may produce false failure
indications.
• With the wings folded, a BIT status indication of GO will only be
displayed for approximately 2 seconds before reverting to a DEGD
indication. BIT status will return to GO when the wings are spread and
locked.
• If the FCS IBIT fails, FCS A and FCS B will indicate DEGD on the
BIT status line. Note surface X’s and/or BLIN codes and contact
maintenance personnel.

• The TIMEUFC option is removed from the HSI format if INS

• At GPS power up (first GEN online), SDC time and date are
automatically sent to the GPS to aid the acquisition of satellites. After
satellite acquisition, the GPS backloads satellite time to the SDC thus
synchronizing the SDC with precise GPS time. This GPS time
backload is only performed once per flight after the initial MC1 power
up.
• Manually changing ZTOD, LTOD, or the DATE with WonW resets
SDC time and/or date and reinitializes the GPS (even if GPS had a
good satellite acquisition). GPS reinitialization will delay the availability of AINS position keeping. GPS time synchronization will not be
available until a subsequent MC1 power-up (cold start). ARC-210

7.5.2 Normal Takeoff. Predictions for takeoff performance (nosewheel liftoff speed, takeoff speed,
takeoff distance, and abort speed) should be calculated in the preflight brief based on aircraft
configuration and expected ambient conditions. These predictions are based on the following
technique: both engines stabilized at 80%N2 rpm, simultaneous brake release and throttle advance to
MIL or MAX, ½-aft (2.5 inches) stick rotation at the predicted nosewheel liftoff speed. This technique
should be used when ambient conditions and performance predictions warrant minimizing takeoff roll.
Review these numbers prior to takeoff.
The takeoff checklist should be completed prior to taking the duty runway. For single-ship takeoffs,
taxi to runway centerline and allow the aircraft to roll forward slightly to center the nosewheel. Begin
the takeoff roll by releasing the brakes, advancing the throttles from IDLE to MIL, and checking EGT
and RPM. If an afterburner takeoff is desired, further advance the throttles to MAX (full forward).
Check for proper afterburner light-off as indicated by both nozzles opening. As the aircraft accelerates
during the takeoff roll, track runway centerline using small rudder pedal inputs (e.g., NWS
commands). NWS is the most effective means of directional control during takeoff. Differential
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-32 ORIGINAL
braking is much less effective and should therefore be avoided. The NWS system (low gain)
incorporates a yaw rate feedback input from the FCCs, which is designed to suppress directional PIO
tendencies by increasing directional damping during takeoff.
At nominal takeoff CG, aft stick will be required to rotate the aircraft. Approaching the predicted
nosewheel liftoff speed, ease the stick back to approximately 1/3 to 1/2 aft stick (1-1/2 to 2-1/2 inches).
Hold this input until the velocity vector rises to approximately 3 to 5°. Capture and climb/accelerate
at the desired flight path angle.
When clear of the ground with a positive rate of climb, raise the LDG GEAR handle and place the
FLAP switch to AUTO. In a flat takeoff attitude with MAX power selected, the aircraft will accelerate
rapidly towards gear speed. If required, reduce power to MIL or below to ensure the landing gear is up
and locked (light in the LDG GEAR handle is out) before passing 250 KCAS.
Takeoff performance is greatly affected by gross weight, center of gravity,
power setting, stabilator position, and ambient conditions. Under adverse
conditions (e.g., hot, heavy, and forward CG), takeoff speeds may be
significantly higher than those routinely seen at nominal conditions.
Knowing the aircraft’s predicted takeoff performance should prevent a
high speed abort in what is a normally functioning aircraft.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-33 ORIGINAL
• Under the most extreme conditions (e.g., hot, heavy, and forward CG),
nosewheel liftoff speed may exceed the nose tire limitation (195 KGS).
The takeoff technique and/or the aircraft configuration may need to
be adjusted to remain within limitations.
• Large aft stick inputs, particularly with CG near the aft limit, can
result in significant over-rotation. With pitch attitude above 10°, the
trailing edge of the stabilators can impact the ground if a large forward
stick input is used to check the over-rotation. Above 14° pitch
attitude, the engine exhaust nozzles may contact the ground. Therefore, pitch attitude shall not exceed 10° on takeoff.
• Takeoff with significant standing water (greater than 1/4 inch) on the
runway may cause water ingestion, which in extreme cases can cause
engine stalls, flameouts, AB blowouts, and/or engine FOD.
7.5.3 Crosswind Takeoff. Crosswind takeoffs should be performed using the normal takeoff technique. However, the pilot should expect to make slightly larger and more frequent rudder pedal inputs
to track runway centerline. As the aircraft accelerates and the ailerons become effective, lateral stick
into the wind may be desired to maintain wings level throughout the remainder of the takeoff roll and
rotation. As the aircraft becomes light on the main wheels, the aircraft will tend to yaw into the wind.
Slight main tire scrubbing can be expected. Allow the aircraft to crab into the wind at takeoff, while
continuing to maintain runway centerline during the gear transition and early climbout.
When calculating crosswind component for takeoff or landing, use the full
value of any reported gusts in your calculations.

descent rates and high humidity. In such conditions, consider preheating the windshield by placing the
DEFOG handle to HIGH and, if necessary, by placing the WINDSHIELD switch to either ANTI ICE
or RAIN. The maximum comfortable cockpit temperature should be maintained to aid in windshield
defog.
Normal instrument penetration is 250 KCAS with a 4,000 to 6,000 feet per minute descent rate. For
safe maneuverability of the aircraft, up to 350 KCAS may be required below 10,000 feet. Refer to

7.7.2 VFR Landing Pattern Entry. See figure 7-3. Typically, the VFR landing pattern can be entered through
several methods: the break, downwind entry, VFR straight-in, or low approach/touch-and-go from a GCA.
Regardless of the entry method, enter the pattern at the altitudes and airspeeds prescribed by local course rules.
A normal break is performed by executing a level turn to downwind with the throttles reduced to IDLE and the
speedbrake function enabled (if required to reduce airspeed). The desired abeam distance is 1.0 to 1.3 nm. The
g-level required to achieve the desired abeam distance will be a fallout of break airspeed.
As airspeed decelerates below 250 KCAS, lower the LDG GEAR handle and place the FLAP switch to FULL.
If enabled, the speedbrake function will retract automatically when the FLAP switch is moved from the AUTO
position. Continue to decelerate to on-speed AOA (8.1 deg). Longitudinal trim inputs are required with the flaps
in HALF or FULL. The MI code for on-speed AOA is unit 14, address 15743, data 3300.
In-flight Memory Inspect (MI) of FCC (UNIT 14 or 15) addresses (ADDR)
greater than six digits long is prohibited since it may cause all four FCC channels
to shut down which will result in loss of aircraft control.
With MC OFP H3E AND UP, the pitch trim AOA value is displayed on the HUD while trimming and for two
seconds after trimming, and continuously on the FCS page with WoffW and flaps in HALF or FULL. The HUD
value is displayed with or without ATC engaged but will not be displayed with autopilot engaged. If the autopilot
is ″paddled off″ and AOA is greater than or equal to 6°, pitch trim is automatically set to on-speed. Trim the
aircraft hands-off and on-speed. Compare airspeed and AOA. Onspeed AOA is approximately 136 KCAS at
44,000 lb gross weight (max trap). Subtract (add) 1½ KCAS for each 1,000 lb decrease (increase) in gross weight.
Complete the landing checklist. When wings level on downwind, descend to pattern altitude (600 ft AGL for the
low pattern). Ensure the ground track pointer is on the exact reciprocal of runway heading.

7.7.3 VFR Landing Pattern and Approach. At the abeam position, pick a spot on the ground as a reference
point. (At the ship, TACAN will be used to adjust abeam distance). Remember this abeam position, as all abeam
distance corrections will use it as a reference. From the abeam position, time 20 seconds to arrive at a no-wind
180° position. To compensate for winds, subtract one second for each knot of final approach headwind
component. At the 180, roll into 27 - 30° AOB, add power, and adjust rate of descent to 300 to 400 fpm. Maintain
on-speed AOA. This should place the velocity vector about 1° below the horizon with its wingtip below the
horizon bar. If required, adjust rate of descent to arrive at the 90° position at 450 ft AGL. Develop an instrument
scan for the turn from the 180 to the 90, because an instrument scan will be required at the ship.
At the 90, glance at runway centerline and the lens and adjust AOB to arrive on extended centerline.
From the 90, rate of descent must be increased by reducing power and adjusting the velocity vector to
1½ to 2° below the horizon, on-speed. This will produce a rate of descent of 400 to 500 fpm to arrive
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
ORIGINAL W/IC 34
III-7-39
at the 45° position at 320-370 feet AGL. From the 45, continue to increase rate of descent to
approximately 500-600 fpm with a power reduction to arrive at ″the start″ on centerline, at 220 to 250
feet AGL, with 650 to 750 fpm rate of descent, on-speed. The optimum rate of descent will vary with
glideslope angle, approach speed, and headwind component.
The approach turn from a pattern altitude greater than 600 ft AGL is slightly different. At the 180,
adjust rate of descent between 400 - 700 fpm to arrive at the 90 at approximately 500 ft AGL. This
requires a power reduction at the 180 rather than a power addition. Power will need to be added at the
90 to break the rate of descent to 400 to 500 fpm in order to arrive at the 45 at the same flight conditions
as the low pattern.
7.7.4 Pattern Adjustments. Deviations to the standard no-wind pattern will be required based on
headwind, crosswind, approach speed, and starts by adjusting abeam distance. Adjust the ground
reference point and fly exactly the same AOB as the previous pass. Correct for long-in-the-groove or
not-enough-straight-away starts by adjusting the timing from the abeam to 180° positions. Correct for
high or low starts by adding or subtracting 20 to 50 feet from the target altitudes at and inside of the
90. The purpose of pattern adjustments is to determine a repeatable pattern technique which will
produce consistent starts.
7.7.5 Final Approach. The desired final approach is flown by maintaining a centered ball to
touchdown on runway centerline and on-speed. Timely, well-controlled power corrections will be
required to capture and/or maintain the desired glideslope. A complete discussion of glideslope
geometry and glideslope corrections will be covered during the FRS training syllabus and/or by
squadron LSOs.
7.7.6 ATC Approaches. If an ATC approach is desired, engage ATC when wings level on downwind
at or near on-speed AOA. With ATC engaged, the aircraft must still be manually trimmed to on-speed
AOA. Unlike a manual throttles approach, nose position (i.e., velocity vector placement) now controls
power. Fly the same pattern as a manual approach. Coming off the 180, roll into 27 to 30° AOB and
lower the velocity vector approximately 1 to 2° below the horizon. ATC will add power as the aircraft
rolls into the turn. Reposition the velocity vector to maintain 300 to 400 fpm rate of descent. Passing
through the 90, lower the velocity vector slightly to pick up a 400 to 500 fpm rate of descent. Rolling
wings level in the groove, lower the velocity vector further to about 3°. Power corrections required to
adjust glideslope are made by repositioning the velocity vector with forward or aft stick inputs. For best
results, make small corrections in velocity vector placement and be smooth. Avoid large, rapid, cyclic
stick motion or ″stick pumping″ as these inputs can produce a PIO with the autothrottles.
Although ATC is capable of handling almost all glideslope corrections, the stick inputs required to
successfully correct large deviations can be difficult to make. In general, if the ball is more than 1 ball
from the center, consider disengaging ATC and executing a manual pass.
7.7.7 FPAH/ROLL - ATC Approaches. The FPAH/ROLL autopilot mode, when utilized with ATC,
provides an alternative method for landing the aircraft. The FPAH/ROLL mode is designed to reduce
pilot workload by maintaining flight path angle (FPA) and roll attitude. When the velocity vector is
positioned as desired and the stick is neutralized, the autopilot maintains the current FPA and roll
attitude, making corrections for wind gusts or disturbances as required. Repositioning the velocity
vector with longitudinal or lateral stick inputs changes the reference FPA and/or roll attitude that the
autopilot holds when the stick is released. In FPAH/ROLL, aircraft response to longitudinal stick
inputs is slightly sluggish compared to CAS while response to lateral stick inputs is essentially the
same.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-40 ORIGINAL
Once the velocity vector is placed in the desired position, the stick is neutralized, and the pilot
essentially monitors autopilot progress. Corrections should be small and applied only when required.
Learning to make appropriate corrections and to stay out-of-the-loop when corrections are not
required takes practice to achieve good results. With practice, smooth, consistent landings can be
achieved even in gusty wind conditions.
NOTE
Use of FPAH/ROLL without ATC may result in more difficult AOA
control and is not recommended.
7.7.7.1 FPAH/ROLL - ATC Approach Technique (field only). If an FPAH/ROLL - ATC approach is
desired, engage ATC when wings level on downwind and trim for on-speed AOA. Select FPAH/ROLL
from the A/P sublevel on the UFCD, and ensure both modes are boxed.
Fly the standard landing pattern utilizing the numbers and velocity vector positioning described in
the ATC Approaches paragraph. A push and roll is required to establish the approach turn. Once the
velocity vector is positioned, neutralize the stick and monitor autopilot progress. No back stick should
be required in the turn. Passing through the 90 and approaching the start, push forward stick to lower
the velocity vector and establish the desired rate of descent and then neutralize the stick. If on
glideslope, roll wings level in the groove using only lateral stick inputs. Longitudinal stick inputs should
not be required, as the autopilot compensates automatically to maintain FPA. Similarly, if on
glideslope, make lineup corrections solely with lateral stick.
If the ball is not centered, adjust the velocity vector (i.e., reference FPA) up or down accordingly and
allow the autopilot to fly the aircraft back to glideslope. Approaching a centered ball, adjust the
velocity vector to the desired flightpath and neutralize the stick. The autopilot should then maintain
FPA (ideally a centered ball) and compensate automatically for gusts. Make corrections with small,
discrete longitudinal stick inputs and evaluate the correction before applying another. If the ball is
centered and stable, the system works best if longitudinal inputs are minimized. There may be
noticeable pitch motion, similar to what is seen on a Mode-1 ACLS approach, as the airplane responds
to gusts, but FPA should be stable.
FPAH/ROLL is less capable at handling large deviations than CAS - ATC. In general, if the ball is
more than 1 ball from the center, consider disengaging FPAH/ROLL with the paddle switch and
executing an ATC or manual pass.
7.7.8 Full Stop Landings. Maintain approach rate of descent and power setting by flying a centered
ball to touchdown or by placing the velocity vector at least 500 feet past the runway threshold. After
touchdown, place the throttles to IDLE and track runway centerline using small rudder pedal inputs.
The engines will not select ground idle until the aircraft has decelerated below 80 KCAS. While the
rudders are effective above 100 KCAS, NWS is the most effective means of directionally controlling the
aircraft during landing rollout. Low gain NWS is activated automatically at touchdown with weight on
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-41 ORIGINAL
the nose landing gear and at least one main landing gear. Differential braking to maintain directional
control is not as effective and should normally be avoided.
Use of NWS HI during landing rollout is not recommended, as it may
lead to directional PIO due to the increased sensitivity of the NWS
system to rudder pedal inputs.
Engaging NWS HI while maintaining a rudder pedal input will greatly
increase nosewheel deflection and may cause loss of directional control.
7.7.9 Braking Technique. Under normal circumstances, the best results are attained by applying
moderate to heavy braking with one smooth application of increasing braking pressure as airspeed
decelerates towards taxi speed. Anti-skid is effective down to approximately 40 KGS. Below 40 KGS,
heavy brake pedal pressure should be relaxed to prevent tire skid. Below 35 KGS, steady but firm
brake pedal pressure should be applied. Steady, light brake applications should be avoided, as they
increase brake heating, do not significantly contribute to deceleration, and ultimately reduce braking
effectiveness. If desired, selecting aft stick (up to full) below 100 KCAS will increase TEU stabilator
deflection and aid in deceleration. Full aft stick increases down force on the main landing gear, as well
as significantly increasing drag due to large stabilator size.
Recommended braking speeds are based on tests conducted at sea level.
Ground speed may be significantly higher than calibrated airspeed at
airfields above sea level. Aircrew should consider available runway length
and field elevation to evaluate wheel brake usage and landing rollout
distance to avoid excessive brake heat build up and subsequent tire
deflation or wheel assembly fire when landing at airfields above sea level.
Maximum braking performance is attained by applying full brake pedal pressure (approximately 125
lb) immediately after touchdown. Anti-skid must be on to attain maximum braking performance and
to reduce the risk of a blown tire. Longitudinal pulsing may be felt as the anti-skid cycles. Approaching
40 KCAS, full brake pedal pressure should be relaxed to prevent tire skid.
7.7.9.1 Aerobraking Technique. Aerobraking is not required under most circumstances. However,
aerobraking is an effective method to slow heavy gross weight aircraft with a reduced risk of hot brakes
and fire, or to slow aircraft on wet runways. Aerobraking is authorized under the following conditions:
a. Crosswind 5 knots or less
b. Pitch attitude 10° or less
c. Greater than 80 KCAS
d. GAIN ORIDE not selected
e. No FCS AIR DAT or FLAP SCHED cautions
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-42 ORIGINAL
f. Flap position not changed during aerobraking
After main landing gear touchdown, smoothly apply aft stick to capture a positive pitch attitude
with the waterline, not to exceed 10°. Directional control can be maintained with rudder pedal inputs
and wings can be leveled with lateral stick. At approximately 100 KCAS, center rudder pedals and
smoothly relax aft stick to allow the nose of the aircraft to fall. Avoid abrupt forward stick inputs to
derotate. Once the nosewheel is on the ground, proceed with normal braking technique. Stopping
distance using aerobraking should be approximately that experienced during normal braking.
Large, abrupt aft stick inputs, particularly with CG near the aft limit, can
result in significant over−rotation. With pitch attitude over 10°, the
trailing edge of the stabilators can impact the ground if a full forward
stick input is used to check the over-rotation. Above 14° pitch attitude,
the raised hook point or engine exhaust nozzles may contact the ground.
Therefore, pitch attitude shall not exceed 10° during aerobraking and
abrupt forward stick inputs to derotate should be avoided.
NOTE
Landing distance data in Chapter XI and the PCL are calculated on
maximum braking performance technique listed above. The effect of
aerobraking is not accounted for in the braking distance performance
charts.
7.7.10 Heavy Gross Weight Landings. The aircraft’s 50,600 lb GW field landing limitation provides
the capability to land with a significant amount of fuel and/or stores (approximately 16,000 lb of
bringback). Landing at heavy gross weight, however, requires that the pilot pay particular attention to
braking technique and overall brake usage to avoid excessive brake and wheel assembly heating, melted
fuse plugs, and deflated tires. The wheel assembly fuse plugs are designed to melt and deflate the tires
at temperatures below those which would result in catastrophic tire blowouts. Wheel assembly
temperatures do not, however, reach their peak until approximately 20 minutes after landing, e.g., it
takes 20 minutes for the heat (energy) imparted to the brake assembly at landing to transfer into the
wheel assembly. Due to this slow transfer of heat, it is not uncommon for an aircraft to pass a post flight
hot brakes check yet still melt a fuse plug in the line.
In general, the aircraft’s braking system is designed for landing under the following circumstances
without melting a fuse plug: land at 50,600 lb GW, maximum anti-skid braking at 115 KCAS, three taxi
stops from 30 KGS, park for 15 minutes, three more taxi stops from 30 KGS. If overall brake usage
exceeds these criteria, melted fuse plugs and deflated tires may result. Below approximately 46,000 lb
GW, brake usage following a maximum anti-skid landing (at or below 90%of approach speed) should
be unlimited. Therefore, any landing above 46,000 lb GW should be considered a heavy gross weight
landing.
7.7.10.1 Heavy Gross Weight Braking Technique. Above 46,000 lb GW, delay the initial brake
application to 115 KCAS or lower, if possible. Utilize aerobraking if desired and runway length is not
a factor, otherwise normal braking technique or maximum anti-skid braking is acceptable. Release the
brakes when desired taxi speed is reached. When clear of the runway, make a conscious effort to limit
taxi speed and minimize brake applications, particularly if maximum anti-skid braking was utilized. If
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-43 ORIGINAL
overall brake usage is extensive, consider chocking the wheels and leaving the parking brake off to aid
in brake cooling and to limit the amount of heat transferred to the wheel assembly.
Recommended braking speeds are based on tests conducted at sea level.
Ground speed may be significantly higher than calibrated airspeed at
airfields above sea level. Aircrew should consider field elevation when
determining the calibrated airspeed at which brakes will be applied to
avoid excessive brake heat build up and subsequent tire delflation or
wheel assembly fire.
7.7.11 Crosswind Landings. During flight test, three crosswind landing techniques were evaluated:
full-crab-to-touchdown, half-crab-kickout, and wing-down-top-rudder. In general, the half-crabkickout technique works best and is recommended for all crosswinds up to 30 knots; the full-crab-totouchdown technique is acceptable for moderate crosswinds only; and the wing-down-top-rudder
technique is not recommended.
When calculating crosswind component for takeoff or landing, use the full
value of any reported gusts in your calculations.
7.7.11.1 Half-Crab Kickout Technique. In crosswinds up to 30 knots, best crosswind landing results
are attained by performing a half-crab-kickout technique. This technique reduces lateral and
directional oscillations after touchdown and minimizes landing gear side loads.
Fly a full crab approach (wings level, neutral pedals) to approximately 50 feet AGL. Immediately
prior to touchdown, apply one smooth rudder pedal input to ″kick out″ half of the crab angle. Maintain
wings level. Allow the initial directional oscillations to subside, then utilize the normal braking
technique. Stabilator braking with up to full aft stick does not degrade directional control and may be
used to aid deceleration. Lateral stick into the wind will be required and is recommended to maintain
wings level during landing rollout.
Avoid removing half the crab angle too early or removing more than half of the crab angle. This may
cause the aircraft to drift downwind prior to touchdown and increases directional transients after
landing.
7.7.11.2 Full-Crab-to-Touchdown Technique. The landing gear is capable of absorbing the sideloads
imparted during a full-crab-to-touchdown landing in crosswinds up to 30 knots. However, in
crosswinds above approximately 15 knots, the aircraft response produced by this technique can be
uncomfortable. When the main gear contact the ground, the aircraft swerves downwind to align with
the runway and rolls away from the crosswind and into the runway. This roll excursion can be as much
as 8°. Two to three directional oscillations can be expected before the aircraft settles out and tracks
straight. While this motion is controllable, lateral stick inputs to level the wings must be timely, and
rudder pedal inputs must be judicious to control the directional transients. For this reason, a
full-crab-to-touchdown technique is not recommended in crosswinds over 15 knots.
In crosswinds below 15 knots, the roll into the runway and ensuing directional oscillations are small,
and the aircraft tends to track straight soon after touchdown. Fly a full-crab approach (wings level,
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-44 ORIGINAL
neutral pedals) all the way to touchdown. Apply lateral stick to keep the wings level, allow the small,
initial directional oscillations to subside, and then utilize the normal braking technique.
7.7.11.3 Wing-Down-Top-Rudder Technique. Even in light to moderate crosswinds, a wing-downtop-rudder approach requires up to full rudder pedal displacement and an excessive bank angle (as
much as 10°) to balance the aircraft with no drift. Landing in this attitude is uncomfortable and should
be avoided. Additionally, any rudder pedal input applied at touchdown produces a large directional
excursion when NWS automatically engages. For these reasons, a wing-down-top-rudder technique is
not recommended.
7.7.12 Wet Runway Landings. Wet runway conditions can induce hydroplaning during landing
rollout. The minimum total hydroplaning speeds of the main landing gear tires (280 psi) and the nose
landing gear tires (150 psi) are 150 KGS and 110 KGS, respectively. Depending on runway conditions,
partial hydroplaning can occur at much lower speeds. If the nose tires are hydroplaning, the aircraft
may respond sluggishly to initial NWS commands. Under such circumstances, increasing rudder pedal
inputs may cause directional excursions when nose tire contact is established. If hydroplaning is
suspected, rudder pedal inputs should be kept as small as practicable.
For wet (standing water) runway conditions, reduce gross weight to the minimum practical. Land
on-speed or slightly slow with the power reduced to idle as soon as possible. Maintaining a constant
attitude and sink rate will help dissipate aircraft energy at touchdown. If directional control is
questionable, do not hesitate to add power, go around, and set up for an arrested landing. If directional
control is comfortable, use maximum anti-skid braking to minimize landing distance.
7.7.13 Asymmetric Stores Landings. The maximum lateral stores asymmetry for field landings is
29,000 ft-lb. For non-crosswind landings, the aircraft handles very much like a symmetrically loaded
aircraft. Trim the aircraft for wings level flight and fly a normal on-speed approach to touchdown.
During periods of moderate to heavy braking, expect the heavy wing to yaw forward. While easily
controlled with small rudder pedal inputs, this motion should be anticipated and countered quickly to
prevent a build up in yaw rate. Best results are attained by judiciously tracking runway centerline with
timely rudder pedal inputs.
For crosswind landings, use the half-crab kickout technique recommended for normal crosswind
landings. At touchdown, expect a slightly larger roll away from the crosswind and into the runway only
if the wind is into the light wing. Lateral stick into the wind will be required and is recommended to
maintain wings level during crosswind landing rollout, particularly when the wind is into the light wing.
Using this technique, asymmetric landings up to 29,000 ft-lb can be safely executed on a normal
3.25° glideslope up to 50,600 lb gross weight and in a 30 knot crosswind.
7.8 POST-FLIGHT CHECKS
7.8.1 After Landing. Do not taxi with the right engine shut down, as normal brakes and NWS are not
available.
7.8.1.1 After Landing Checks.
When clear of active runway -
1. Ejection seat SAFE/ARMED handle(s) - SAFE (confirm status in both cockpits)
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-45 ORIGINAL
2. EJECTION MODE handle - NORM
Make sure the ejection seat SAFE/ARMED handle is locked in the SAFE
position detent and that the word SAFE is completely visible on the
inboard side of the handle. If the handle will not lock in the detent or the
word SAFE is not completely visible, check to ensure that the ejection
control handle is fully stowed and attempt to resafe the seat. If unable to
properly safe the ejection seat, instruct line personnel to remain clear of
the cockpit until the seat is checked by qualified maintenance personnel.
3. Landing gear handle mechanical stop - CHECK FULLY ENGAGED
If the DOWNLOCK ORIDE button is pressed or the mechanical stop is
not fully engaged, the LDG GEAR handle can be raised on the ground,
and the main landing gear will retract.
4. FLAP switch - AUTO
5. T/O TRIM button - PRESS UNTIL TRIM ADVISORY DISPLAYED
6. Mask - OFF (confirm status both cockpits)
7. OBOGS system - SECURE
a. OXY FLOW knob - OFF (both cockpits)
b. OBOGS control switch - OFF
8. Canopy - EITHER FULL UP OR FULL DOWN FOR TAXI
• Taxiing with canopy at an intermediate position can result in canopy
attach point damage and failure.
• Prior to operating the canopy switch, confirm aircrew are clear and all
loose equipment is stowed to reduce the potential for injury and/or
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-7-46 ORIGINAL
engine FOD.
NOTE
Once the ejection seat(s) are confirmed SAFE and the EJECTION
MODE handle is in the NORM position, it is safe to unstrap.
Adjusting seat height after the upper Koch fittings are removed may
damage the ejection seat trombone fittings.
7.8.2 Hot Refueling. When hot refueling for a subsequent flight, the RADAR switch may be left in
OPR or STBY. However, if feed tank fuel temperatures are approaching their 79°C limit, consider
turning off the radar to aid in RLCS/fuel cooling.
Hot refueling must be performed with the canopy closed. Expect the REFUEL DR caution to be
displayed when ground crew open door 8R to expose the single point refueling receptacle. If refueling
of external tanks is not desired, the appropriate EXT TANKS switches must be placed to STOP.
Otherwise, hot refueling through the single point receptacle will fill all internal and external tanks.
NOTE
When hot refueling in Lots 21 thru 25, the IFR probe must be
extended to refuel any external fuel tanks loaded on the inboard
stations (4 and 8) when external fuel tanks are loaded on the midboard
stations (3 and 9).
The EFD and/or FUEL display can be referenced to monitor refueling progress. Expect external
tanks to refuel slowly until the internal tanks are full.
If an internal tank refuel valve has failed or is leaking, that tank will overfill and direct fuel into the
aircraft vent system. If the aircraft vent tanks overflow, fuel will spill from the vertical tail vent outlets.
When hot refueling is complete, ensure that the fuel cap is properly installed and door 8R is closed:
the REFUEL DR caution should be out and the plane captain/final checker shall give the confirmation
signal. This signal is a cupped, open hand rotated counterclockwise then clockwise followed by a
thumbs up.
For a subsequent flight, expect final checks prior to taxi for takeoff. If placed to OFF prior to
refueling, the RADAR switch may be reselected to OPR when refueling is complete.
A failed or leaking refuel valve can cause rapid overfilling of the aircraft
vent system, fuel spillage from the vent outlet(s), and possible fire if fuel
spills on hot engine components. If this occurs, discontinue hot refueling
immediately.

CHAPTER 8
Carrier-Based Procedures
8.1 GENERAL
The CV and LSO NATOPS Manuals are the governing publications for carrier-based operations and
procedures. All flight crewmembers shall be familiar with CV NATOPS procedures prior to carrier
operations.
8.2 DAY OPERATIONS
8.2.1 Preflight Checks.
1. Exterior Inspection - Perform IAW NATOPS
Conduct a normal preflight inspection with particular attention given to the landing gear, day ID
light, struts, tires, and arresting hook. Check the underside of the fuselage and stabilators for
possible arresting cable damage. Note the relationship of the APU exhaust port and the arresting
hook to the deck edge and, for example, catwalk fire extinguishers. If APU exhaust is a factor, the
aircraft may need to be respotted prior to start. Do not lower the hook during poststart checks
unless the hook point will drop onto the flight deck. A hook check may have to be delayed until
the aircraft is taxiied forward. Make sure sufficient clearance exists for cycling ALL control
surfaces.
The maximum wind allowed for canopy opening is 60 kt. Opening the
canopy in headwinds of more than 60 kt or in gusty or variable wind
conditions may result in damage to or loss of the canopy.
2. Interior Checks - Perform IAW NATOPS with two exceptions:
a. External lights master switch - OFF (Required for proper operation of the Day ID strobe light
on the nose landing gear)
b. ANTI SKID switch - OFF
Ensure the ANTI SKID switch is OFF for all carrier operations to ensure
that full brake authority is available (including locking a tire).
8.2.2 Hangar Deck Operation. Occasionally the aircraft may be manned on the hangar deck. Follow
the same procedures as those concerning flight deck operations.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-8-1 ORIGINAL
Tiedowns shall not be removed from the aircraft unless the emergency brake accumulator pressure
gauge indicates at least 2,600 psi. Emergency brakes shall be used for stopping the aircraft anytime it
is being moved while the engines are not running. The signal to stop an aircraft that is being towed is
either a hand signal or a whistle blast. The whistle signifies an immediate or emergency stop. Once in
the cockpit, leave the canopy open and helmet off to ensure hearing the whistle. Keep the taxi director
in sight at all times. If unable to see the taxi director, or if in doubt of safe aircraft movement, stop the
aircraft immediately.
If the aircraft is not already on the elevator, it will be towed or pushed (with the pilot in the cockpit)
into position to be raised to the flight deck. Ensure tiedowns are in place; set the parking brake; and
close the canopy. Ensure the parking brake is set anytime the aircraft is stopped on the elevator.
8.2.3 Engine Start. Do not start the engines until directed to do so by the tower/Air Boss, typically
30 minutes prior to the stated launch time. APU starts should be made whenever possible. Crossbleed
starts must be approved by the Air Boss due to the relatively high power setting required, and the
potential for injury from jet blast.
8.2.3.1 Before Taxi Checks.
1. Before Taxi Checks - Perform IAW NATOPS and ensure:
a. FLAP switch - FULL
b. TRIM - SET FOR CATAPULT LAUNCH
Ensure the T/O TRIM button is pressed until the TRIM advisory is displayed (stabilators 4°
TEU). Horizontal stabilator trim should be manually set for catapult launch IAW figure 8-1
Tables A thru G. Launches with less than 15 knot excess endspeed require additional trim to
compensate for the reduced launch speed. If the aircraft is loaded asymmetrically, lateral trim
(differential stabilator with WonW) should also be manually set IAW figure 8-1 Table G. Trim
laterally into the light wing (unloaded wing down). The trim settings are designed to keep roll
off less than 5° for 3 seconds after WoffW. Obviously, not all possible external store
configurations could be evaluated. Therefore, some external store configurations may exhibit
more or less roll off at the Table G trim setting. Launches above 15 knots excess would require
less lateral trim. Higher excess endspeeds, mis-set trim conditions were tested and the aircraft
is easily controlled with lateral stick. The key is to trim in the correct direction, which is
unloaded wing down.
Correct stabilator trim is critical to aircraft fly-away performance (hands-off). The stabilator
trim setting determines the aircraft’s initial pitch rate and sets the reference AOA that the FCS
attempts to hold after launch. Reference AOA is set to 12° when the stabilators are trimmed
to 6° TEU or higher. Between 4° and 6° TEU stabilator, reference AOA is steeply changed
from 4° to 12°. The recommended launch trim settings are designed to provide the aircraft
with a consistent 10° to 12°/sec pitch rate regardless of gross weight, CG, or catapult endspeed.
Trim settings above those recommended in tables D and E or launches with greater than 15
knot excess endspeed will maintain the 12° reference AOA but will be characterized by
increased pitch rates. Normal catapult launches are characterized by an initial rotation as high
as 13° AOA before AOA and pitch rate feedbacks reduce AOA to the reference value. For light
gross weight launches, peak pitch rates will be higher and peak AOA’s will be lower due to the
Vmc based launch speed. At heavier gross weights, a range of 10° thru 14° AOA can be
expected during launch and is the best compromise between minimizing sink-off-bow and
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-8-2 ORIGINAL
ensuring controllability in the event of an engine failure. If stabilator trim is less than 6.5°, the
CK TRIM caution will be set when the throttles are advanced above 27° THA (FLAP switch
FULL).
c. External fuel tank quantities - CHECK
Do not catapult with partially full external fuel tank(s) (≤2,700 lbs). Fuel
sloshing may cause structural damage to the tanks, pylons, and/or
airframe.

5. Longitudinal trim MUST be adjusted for the aft CG shift that occurs during normal fuel burn.
The CG can shift as much as 3% MAC (F/A-18E) or 1% MAC (F/A-18F) when Tank 2 fuel drops to
approximately 2,200 lb and Tank 1 fuel drops to approximately 1,000 lb. This CG shift can affect
longitudinal trim by as much as 7° and must be accounted for to prevent catapult launch with a
significant over-trim. Once Tank 1 has dropped to approximately 1,000 lb, fuel scheduling maintains
the CG at an essentially neutral position. Table F is a rule-of-thumb for decreasing longitudinal trim
based solely on Tank 1 fuel quantity. Decrease baseline longitudinal trim by the ‘‘Trim Delta’’ value
down to but in no case less than 7° TEU stabilator.

Failure to make Tank 1 fuel quantity trim adjustment will result in an
over trimmed condition, which may aggravate aircraft controllability,
particularly following a single engine failure.
NOTE
If longitudinal trim must be adjusted after differential stabilator has
been input for a lateral weight asymmetry, push the T/O TRIM
button, adjust longitudinal trim and re-input differential stabilator.

Therefore, if you set longitudinal trim of 9° nose up, a 2° differential stabilator trim would result in
an 8/10 or 10/8 nose up stabilator trim (depending on asymmetric loading) setting on the DDI FCS
page.
Failure to input differential stabilator trim for catapult launches with
asymmetric stores can aggravate aircraft controllability, particularly
following a single engine failure.

8.2.5 Taxi. The canopy should be down with oxygen mask on and the ejection seat armed prior to
aircraft breakdown and during taxi. Taxiing aboard ship is similar to confined area taxiing ashore.
However, be aware of jet exhaust from other aircraft and the relative position of own nozzles. Typically,
the wings are folded until the aircraft is positioned behind the jet blast deflector (JBD), so full-time
NWS HI should normally be available. NWS HI is recommended for carrier operations and should
provide excellent turning capability for directional control aboard ship. Taxi speed should be kept
under control at all times, especially on wet decks, in the landing area, and approaching the catapult.
Taxi signals from the flight deck directors (yellow shirts) are mandatory.
Be prepared to use the emergency brakes should normal braking fail. In the event of loss of brakes,
inform the tower and lower the tailhook immediately to indicate brake loss to deck personnel.
8.2.6 Takeoff Checks.

8.2.6.1 Catapult Hook-Up. The aircraft will be taxiied over the JBD and aligned with the catapult
track. Approach the catapult track slowly, lightly riding the brakes with NWS engaged. Use the
minimum power required to keep the aircraft rolling. Close attention to taxi director signals is required
to properly align the aircraft with the catapult track entry wye. If the taxi director is obscured by steam
from the catapult, stop the aircraft.
Prior to taxi past the shuttle -
4. Weight board - ″Roger″ gross weight and asymmetry level (if in accordance with figure 8.1, Tables
B and C). The hundreds place on the weight board designates the asymmetry level (see figure 8-1
Table C) in order to set the proper catapult settings for launch. For example, if the aircraft’s gross
weight is 60,000 lb with 9,000 ft-lb of asymmetry, the 9,000 ft-lb falls within asymmetry level 1,
and the aircrew will ″Roger″ a weight board that reads 60,100.

Once the launch bar has been lowered, do not engage NWS unless directed to do so, since catapult
personnel may be in close proximity to the launch bar. Once the launch bar enters the catapult track,
do not use NWS. The catapult crew will install the holdback bar as the aircraft taxis forward. Taxi
forward slowly, following the signals of the taxi director or Catapult Officer. When the launch bar
drops over the shuttle spreader, the aircraft will be stopped by the holdback bar engaging the
catapult buffer.

Failure to place the LAUNCH BAR switch to RETRACT prior to
catapult launch may result in hydraulic seal failure and possible loss of
HYD 2A.

14. Salute with right hand. Hold throttles firmly against the detent and place head against the
headrest.
Throttle friction may be used to help prevent inadvertent retraction of the throttles during the
catapult stroke. If required, it can be overridden if afterburner is needed due to aircraft/catapult
malfunction. Immediately after the end of the catapult stroke, the aircraft will rotate to capture the
12° reference AOA (hands-off). To avoid PIO with the FCS, do not restrain the stick during catapult
launch or make stick inputs immediately after catapult launch. The pilot should attempt to remain
out of the loop but should closely monitor the catapult sequence.
To reduce engine susceptibility to hot gas reingestion and compressor
stalls, transition from MIL to MAX during the catapult stroke shall not
be performed except in an emergency.
Once safely airborne -
15. LDG GEAR handle - UP
16. Clearing turn - PERFORM (if required)
With positive rate of climb and clearing turn complete -
17. FLAP switch - AUTO
NOTE
During catapult launches performed at heavy gross weight, the TEFs
may begin to retract prior to FLAP switch actuation (at approximately
190 KCAS) in order to follow the loads alleviation schedule.
8.2.7.1 Catapult Suspend. To stop the launch while in tension on the catapult, signal by shaking the
head negatively and transmitting “SUSPEND, SUSPEND” on land/launch frequency. Do not use a
thumbs down signal or any hand signal that might be mistaken for a salute. The Catapult Officer will
reply with a “SUSPEND” signal followed by an “UNTENSION AIRPLANE ON CATAPULT” signal.
The shuttle spreader will be moved aft and the launch bar will automatically raise clear of the shuttle
spreader. Maintain power at MIL or MAX until the Catapult Officer steps in front of the aircraft and
gives the “throttle-back”. The same signals will be used when a catapult malfunction exists.
8.2.7.2 Catapult Endspeed Requirements. Catapult endspeeds are established to provide safe
flyaway during normal launch conditions and to allow the pilot to maintain aircraft control in the event
of a single engine failure. The catapult endspeeds are not based on single engine rate of climb (SEROC)
capability, nor do they guarantee single engine flyaway performance. The minimum endspeed
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-8-11 ORIGINAL
requirement is calculated to provide sufficient airspeed and altitude to maintain aircraft control while
executing emergency catapult flyaway procedures.
F/A-18E/F minimum catapult launch endspeeds are governed by three limiting factors: Flaps FULL
minimum single engine control speed (Vmc), maximum longitudinal acceleration capability, and
sink-off-bow. Vmc is the airspeed below which the aircraft is not controllable with a single engine
failure. The Vmc airspeed governs the endspeed for most of the gross weight range in both MIL and
MAX power (up to 60K MIL and 65K MAX, see figure 8-1, Table B). Vmc is also a function of lateral
weight asymmetry; therefore, endspeed must be increased for asymmetric loadings (see figure 8-1,
Table C). The catapult endspeed above 60K in MIL is governed by aircraft longitudinal acceleration
capability which limits maximum gross weight for MIL power launches (see figure 8-1, Table A).
Endspeeds above 65K in MAX are governed by the aircraft CG 10 foot sink-off-bow limit. Actual
catapult endspeeds in the Aircraft Launching Bulletins are computed to launch at the minimum
endspeed plus 15 knots (Vmin +15) (figure 8-1, Table B and C). FULL flap launches are required to
meet wind-over-deck requirements at heavy gross weights. HALF flap launches have not been tested,
and would increase launch wind-over-deck by approximately 10 knots.
8.2.7.3 Catapult Launch Flyaway Characteristics. Launches at light gross weights are characterized
by higher pitch rate and attitude, higher rate of climb, and lower peak AOA when compared to heavy
gross weight launches. Forward stick may be required following the rotation to control pitch attitude
as the aircraft accelerates.
There is a noticeable difference in aircraft flyaway characteristics from light to heavy weights due to
the transition from the Vmc based launch speeds to either the longitudinal acceleration or sink-off-bow
based airspeeds. Heavy weight launches will be characterized by reduced pitch rates and attitudes, and
higher peak AOA when compared to the light weight launches. Light buffet may be felt as the aircraft
rotates through 11° AOA during launch at heavier gross weights. The longitudinal trim settings will
provide the required 10-12°/sec pitch rate and capture a target AOA of 12°; however, peak AOA may
reach 15° momentarily. Maintaining hands off the stick during rotation is crucial to optimizing launch
performance and reduces the tendency for pilot induced oscillations during rotation and initial
flyaway. With normal endspeed and steady deck conditions, the aircraft CG settles up to 3 feet. The
pilot perceives the catapult launch to be level, as rotation keeps the pilot’s eye approximately level even
though the aircraft CG sinks. With less than 15 knots of excess endspeed, more settle will occur up to
a maximum of 10 feet of settle with zero excess endspeed. Launches anticipated with less than the
normal 15 knot excess endspeed require additional longitudinal trim to compensate for the reduced
launch speed. A 10 knot excess endspeed launch would require 4° additional nose up trim from the
nominal settings in figure 8-1, Tables D and E.
8.2.8 Landing Pattern. Refer to Chapter 4, for carrier operating limitations. While maneuvering to
enter the traffic pattern, attempt to determine the sea state. This information will be of value in
predicting problems that may be encountered during the approach and landing.
Enter the carrier landing pattern at 800 feet AGL (figure 8-2) with the hook down. Make a level
break from a course parallel to the Base Recovery Course (BRC), close aboard to the starboard side of
the ship. Below 250 KCAS lower the gear and flaps. The speedbrake function automatically retracts
when the FLAP switch is moved to HALF or FULL. Descend to 600 feet AGL when established
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-8-12 ORIGINAL
Figure 8-2. Carrier Landing Pattern
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-8-13 ORIGINAL
downwind and prior to the 180° position. Complete the landing checklist and crosscheck AOA and
airspeed (136 KCAS at 44,000 lb GW minus 1.5 KCAS for each 1,000 lb decrease in GW).
NOTE
Flaps HALF or FULL may be used for landing provided the minimum
wind-over-deck (WOD) requirements of the Aircraft Recovery Bulletin
(ARB) are met. As WOD increases above 30 kt, handling qualities in
flaps HALF are slightly improved over flaps FULL and are
recommended to avoid ″settle at the ramp″ situations.
To assist in achieving the desired abeam distance of 1.1 to 1.3 nm: select the 10 nm scale on the HSI
display, select ship’s TCN, and adjust the course line to the BRC. On downwind fly to place the wingtip
of the HSI airplane symbol on the course line. Ensure the ground track pointer is on the exact
reciprocal of the BRC. Select ILS if desired and available.
With 25-30 kt winds over deck begin the 180° turn to the final approach when approximately abeam
the LSO platform or when the ″white″ of the round down becomes visible. Use an instrument scan from
the 180 to the 90. Fly the pattern as described in the VFR Pattern and Approach section of Chapter
7. Adjust the 90 altitude up slightly to account for the height of the ship’s deck, usually 500 feet AGL
versus 450 feet AGL. Target 360 feet crossing the wake. The rate of descent required to maintain
glideslope may be slightly less than on FCLP approaches due to wind over deck. Expect slightly higher
throttle settings. When the meatball is acquired, transmit “SIDE NUMBER, RHINO, BALL, (fuel
state in thousands of pounds to the nearest 100 pound), AUTO” (if using ATC for approach) e.g. ″206,
RHINO, BALL, 7.5, Auto″. If unable to see any or all of the following: the meatball, datums, or
centerline, transmit (SIDE NUMBER, CLARA/CLARA datums/CLARA lineup.″ (e.g. ″206,
CLARA″). See figure 8-3 for a typical Carrier Controlled Approach.
8.2.8.1 ATC Approach Mode Technique. Refer to the ATC Approaches section of Chapter 7 for
basics on ATC operations. ATC stick-to-throttle gains are designed to allow correction of settles or
updrafts with small, rapid stick movements. Close-in corrections are very critical. If a large attitude
correction for a high-in-close situation develops, the recommended procedure is to stop ball motion,
making no attempt to recenter the ball. A low-in-close condition is difficult to correct with ATC and
may result in an over-the-top bolter. It may be necessary to downgrade from ATC and fly manually to
safely recover from a low-in-close condition. The force required to manually disengage ATC is
significant and may prevent salvaging the pass. Large deviations from glideslope may be difficult to
correct with ATC. Typically, ATC should be disengaged if more than one ball from center (or upon
LSO direction) and the approach continued manually.
8.2.8.2 Glideslope. The technique for maintaining glideslope is basically the same as FCLP except
that more power may be required. Maintaining centerline will most likely require more line-up
corrections due to the angled deck. With rough seas and a pitching deck, some erratic ball movement
may be encountered. If this is the case, listen to LSO calls and attempt to average out ball movement
to maintain a safe, controlled approach.
8.2.8.3 Waveoff. When the waveoff signal is received, select MIL (MAX if required) and maintain
on-speed AOA with the E-bracket until rate of descent is arrested and 10° pitch attitude is captured
for climb to pattern altitude. Best rate of climb occurs at on-speed AOA regardless of loading or
configuration. This requires slight back stick pressure as the aircraft accelerates. If ATC is engaged,
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-8-14 ORIGINAL
immediately disengage ATC or apply enough force to override ATC while advancing the throttles to
MIL or MAX. Do not over-rotate.
An in-close or late waveoff, coupled with an over-rotation can lead to an
in-flight engagement, which can severely damage the aircraft and/or
arresting gear.
8.3 ACL MODE 1 AND 1A APPROACHES
A typical Mode 1 and 1A approach is shown in figure 8-4. The Mode 1/1A approach does not require
ATC, but ATC should normally be used. The following procedure is typical for a Mode 1 (1A) approach
from marshal to touchdown (or 0.5 mile).
1. Request a Mode 1 or Mode 1A approach from Marshal.
2. HSI format - SELECT (box) ACL
When the ACL option is boxed, the LINK 4 format automatically appears on the LDDI, and the
ACL mode automatically starts its self test. At this time, the ILS, data link, and radar beacon are
automatically turned on (if not previously on), and IBIT is run on the data link and radar beacon
systems. Also, the uplinked universal test message is monitored for valid receipt.
3. Onboard ACL Capability - CHECK
a. LINK 4 format - CHECK FOR ACL 1
Mode 1/1A capability is not available if ACL 1 is not displayed.
b. BIT page, NAV Sublevel - Verify AUG GO/PBIT GO
An augmentor degrade does not inhibit ACL coupling. A degraded
augmenter may lead to a significant lineup error, most often tending
right-of-centerline.
4. Report departing marshal - ″SIDE NUMBER, COMMENCING″
5. Normal CCA - PERFORM
Descend at 250 KCAS and 4,000 fpm to 5,000 feet, (platform) then reduce rate of descent to 2,000

11. RALT hold mode - ENGAGE (if desired)
ACL acquisition occurs at approximately 3.5 to 8 nm and is indicated by ACL RDY on the LINK 4
format and the data link steering (TADPOLE) on the HUD. It is desired but not required, to have
ACL coupled at least 30 seconds before tipover. T/C is replaced by MODE 1 on the LINK 4 format.
After ACL Acquisition -
12. Report needle position - e.g., ″UP AND ON″ or ″UP AND RIGHT″.
For Mode 1, when directed -
13. CPL option - SELECT on UFCD
If T/C is engaged, press CPL once to uncouple T/C then press CPL again to couple ACL. When
the aircraft is not coupled, ACL RDY is displayed on the HUD. ACL couple is indicated by CMD
CNT and MODE 1 on the LINK 4 format and CPLD P/R on the UFCD and HUD. At this time,
the uplinked command displays of heading, airspeed, altitude, and rate of descent are removed
from the LINK 4 format and the HUD.

13. After touchdown, ACL and ATC should be automatically disengaged.
NOTE
After Mode 1 or 1A downgrade or touch-and-go, actuate the paddle
switch to ensure complete autopilot disengagement.
8.4 ACL MODE 2 APPROACH
A typical ACL Mode 2 approach is shown in figure 8-5. For a Mode 2 approach, the HUD data link
steering is used to fly a manual approach.
1. HSI format - SELECT (box) ACL
When the ACL option is boxed, the LINK 4 format automatically appears on the LDDI, and the
ACL mode automatically starts its self test. At this time, the ILS, data link, and radar beacon are
automatically turned on (if not previously on), and IBIT is run on the data link and radar beacon
systems. Also, the uplinked universal test message is monitored for valid receipt.
2. LINK 4 format - CHECK FOR ACL 1 or ACL 2
Mode 2 capability is not available if ACL 1 or ACL 2 is not displayed.

8.5 ARRESTED LANDING AND EXIT FROM THE LANDING AREA
1. Fly an on-speed, on centerline, centered-ball approach all the way to touchdown.
At touchdown -
2. Throttles - MIL
To reduce aircraft and arresting gear loads and required recovery windover-deck, selection of MAX power at touchdown shall not be performed
except in an emergency.
When forward motion ceases -
3. Throttles - IDLE and allow the aircraft to roll aft.
When directed -
4. Brakes - APPLY
5. HOOK handle - UP
If the wire does not clear the hook, the taxi director will signal to lower the hook for aircraft
pullback.
6. FLAP switch - AUTO
7. WINGFOLD switch - HOLD or FOLD (HOLD if wingtip missile dearming required)
8. NWS button - ENGAGE NWS HI
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-8-20 ORIGINAL
When the come ahead signal is received, add power, release brakes, and exit the landing area
cautiously and expeditiously. Taxi the aircraft as directed. Do not use excessive power. If one or both
brakes fail, utilize the emergency brakes; advise the tower; and drop the arresting hook.
Once spotted, keep the engines running until the taxi director signals engine shutdown and the
aircraft is properly chocked and chained.
8.6 SECTION CCA
A section CCA may be necessary when a failure occurs which affects navigation aids, communications equipment, or other aircraft systems. Normally, the aircraft experiencing the difficulty flies the
parade position on the starboard side during the approach. When the meatball is sighted, but no lower
than 300 feet AGL, the section leader breaks away from the wingman in a climbing left turn. The
section leader should climb to 1,200 feet AGL, or below an overcast, in the bolter configuration, and
position himself at the wingman’s 11:00 o’clock position. If the wingman bolters or waves-off, he should
rendezvous in the bolter configuration on the section leader. If a wave-off is required prior to flight
break-up, the flight leader executes a climbing right turn to 1,200 feet AGL and follows the directions
of CATCC. Necessary lighting signals between aircraft are contained in Chapter 26.
NOTE
A section penetration should not be made to the ship with less than
non-precision minimums.
8.7 NIGHT OPERATIONS
8.7.1 General. Night carrier operations have a much slower tempo than day operations and it is the
pilot’s responsibility to maintain this tempo. Standard daytime hand signals from deck crew to pilot
are executed with light wands. The procedures outlined here are different from, or in addition to,
normal day carrier operations.
8.7.2 Preflight. Conduct the exterior preflight using a white-lensed flashlight. Ensure that the
exterior lights are properly set for night launch and the external lights master switch is OFF before
engine start. Ensure that instrument and console light knobs are on. This will reduce the brilliance of
the warning and advisory lights when the generators come online.
8.7.3 Before Taxi. Adjust cockpit lighting as desired and perform Before Taxi Checks.
8.7.4 Taxi. Slow and careful handling by taxi directors and pilots is mandatory. If any doubt exists
as to taxi director signals, stop the aircraft. At night it is very difficult to determine speed and motion
over the deck, so the pilot must rely on the taxi director signals, following them closely.
8.7.5 Catapult Hook-Up. Maneuvering the aircraft for catapult hook-up at night is identical to that
used in day operations; however, it is difficult to determine speed or degree of motion over the deck.
If the taxi director is obscured by steam from the catapult, stop the aircraft.
8.7.6 Catapult Launch. At night, catapult procedures are the same as daytime, except signals are
provided by lights instead of hand signals. The exterior lights are utilized to signal that the pilot is
ready for launch. After the control wipeout, select the ADI for display on a DDI or the UFCD in case
the HUD should be lost during or immediately after launch. When ready for launch, place external
lights master switch to ON.

III-8-21 ORIGINAL
Figure 8-5. ACL Mode 2 Approach
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-8-22 ORIGINAL
All exterior lights (position, formation, and strobes) should be on. If instrument meteorological
conditions are expected shortly after launch, the strobes may be left off at the discretion of the pilot.
After launch, monitor rotation of the aircraft to 12° AOA, crosschecking all instruments to ensure
a positive rate of climb. When comfortably climbing, retract the landing gear and flaps and proceed on
the departure IAW CV NATOPS.
8.7.7 Catapult Suspend. To stop the launch while in tension on the catapult, do not turn on the
exterior lights and transmit “SUSPEND, SUSPEND”. Maintain MIL/MAX power until the catapult
officer walks in front of the wing and gives the throttle-back signal. If the external lights master switch
has been placed on prior to ascertaining that the aircraft is down, transmit “SUSPEND, SUSPEND”
and turn off the exterior lights and leave the throttles at MIL until signaled to reduce power.
8.7.8 Night Landings. Night and instrument recoveries will normally be made using case III
procedures IAW CV NATOPS. Prior to departing marshal, change the IDENT switch on the exterior
lights panel to the NORM position. Make sure the strobe lights are flashing a 3 flash, pause, repeat
pattern.
8.7.9 AN/APG-79 AESA Considerations. Aircrew operating AN/APG-79 AESA equipped aircraft
shall be aware that directing AN/APG-79 AESA transmissions toward the ship while on approach may
cause strong electromagnetic interference (EMI) affecting the safety of aircraft on approach. Unless
specifically authorized for operational necessity or required for safety of flight, aircrew shall cease
AN/APG-79 AESA radar transmissions whenever operating within 10 nm of the ship while on
approach during IMC/Case III conditions. Reference Chapter 4.4 for AN/APG-79 AESA radar
limitations.
8.7.10 Arrestment and Exit From the Landing Area. During the approach, all exterior lights should
be on with the exception of the landing/taxi light. Following arrestment, immediately turn the external
lights master switch off. Taxi clear of the landing area following taxi director signals. If brakes are lost,
signal by lowering the hook, turning on exterior lights, and transmitting on land/launch frequency.

CHAPTER 9
Special Procedures
9.1 FORMATION FLIGHT
9.1.1 Formation Taxi/Takeoff. During section taxi, ensure adequate clearance between flight lead’s
stabilator and wingman’s wing/missile rail is maintained. The leader will take position on the
downwind side of the runway with other aircraft in tactical order, maintaining normal parade bearing.
See figure 9-1. For three aircraft formations, line up with the lead on the downwind side, number 2 on
the centerline, and number 3 on the upwind side. Wingtip/launch rail overlap should not be required
but is permitted if necessary. For four plane formations, line up with the lead’s section on the
downwind half of the runway and other section on the upwind half. When Before Takeoff checks are
completed and the flight is in position, each pilot looks over the next aircraft to ensure the speed brake
is retracted (spoilers down), the flaps are set for takeoff, all panels are closed, no fluids are leaking,
safety pins are removed, rudders are toed-in, nosewheel is straight, and the launch bar is up. Beginning
with the last aircraft in the flight, a “thumb up” is passed toward the lead to indicate “ready for
takeoff”.
9.1.1.1 Section Takeoff. For section takeoff, all aspects of the takeoff must be prebriefed by the
flight leader, to include flap settings; use of nosewheel steering; power changes; power settings; and
signals for actuation of landing gear, flaps, and afterburner. Engines are run up to approximately 80%,
instruments checked, and nosewheel steering low gain ensured. On signal from the leader, brakes are
released and throttles are advanced to military power minus 2% rpm. If afterburner is desired, the
leader may go into mid range burner immediately without stopping at military power. Normal takeoff
techniques should be used by the leader, with the wingman striving to match the lead aircraft attitude
as well as maintain a position in parade bearing with wingtip separation. The gear and flaps are
retracted on signal. Turns into the wingman shall not be made at altitudes less than 500 feet above
ground level.
9.1.2 Aborted Takeoff. In the event of an aborted takeoff, the aircraft aborting must immediately
notify the other aircraft. The aircraft not aborting should add max power and accelerate ahead and out
of the way of the aborting aircraft. This allows the aborting aircraft to steer to the center of the runway
and engage the arresting gear, if required.
9.1.3 Parade. The parade position is established by superimposing the front of the wingtip missile
rail over the pilot’s headbox. Superimposing the two establishes a bearing line and step down. Proper
wingtip clearance is set by reference to the exhaust nozzles. When the left and right nozzles are aligned
so that there is no detectable curve to the nozzles, the reference line is correct. The intersection of the
reference line with the bearing line is the proper parade position. See figure 9-2.
Parade turns are either standard (VFR) or instrument turns. During day VFR conditions, turns
away from the wingman are standard turns. To execute, when lead turns away, the wingmen roll the
aircraft about its own axis and increase power slightly to maintain rate of turn with the leader. Lateral
separation is maintained by increasing g. Proper step down is maintained by keeping the lead’s fuselage
on the horizon.
Turns into the wingmen and all IFR or night turns in a parade formation are instrument turns.
During instrument turns maintain a parade position relative to the lead throughout the turn.

III-9-3 ORIGINAL
After initially joining up in echelon, three and four plane formations normally use balanced parade
formation. In balanced parade number 3 steps out until the exhaust nozzles on number 2 are flush. This
leaves enough space between number 3 and lead for number 2 to cross under into echelon.
When it is necessary to enter IFR conditions with a three or four plane formation, the lead directs
the flight to assume fingertip formation. In this formation number 3 moves up into close parade on the
lead. All turns are instrument turns.
9.1.4 Balanced Cruise Formation. The balanced cruise position is a looser formation which allows
the wingmen more time for visual lookout. Balanced cruise provides the wingmen with a cone of
maneuver behind the leader which allows the wingman to make turns by pulling inside the leader, and
requires little throttle change.
The balanced cruise position is defined by the wingman aligning his headbox with the front of lead’s
wingtip missile rail and headbox, and lead’s arresting hook fairing with the opposite wing formation
light. The wingmen are free to maneuver within the cone established by that bearing line on either
wing. In a division formation, number 3 should fly the bearing line but always leave adequate room for
number 2 and lead. Number 4 flies balanced cruise about number 3.
9.1.5 Section Approaches/Landing. The aircraft is comfortable to fly in formation, even at the low
airspeeds associated with an approach and landing. The rapid power response enhances position
keeping ability. The formation strip lighting provides a ready visual reference at night and the dual
radios generally ensure that intra-flight comm is available.
Figure 9-2. Formations (Sheet 2 of 2)
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-9-4 ORIGINAL
During section approaches all turns are “instrument” turns about the leader. When a penetration is
commenced the leader retards power to 75% rpm and descends at 250 KIAS. If a greater descent rate
is required the speed brake may be used. Approximately 5 miles from the final approach fix or GCA
pickup the lead gives the signal for landing gear.
9.1.5.1 Section Landing. If a section landing is to be made, lead continues to maintain ON-SPEED
for the heaviest aircraft and flies a centered ball pass to touchdown on the center of one side of the
runway. Wingman flies the normal parade position, taking care not to be stepped up.
When “in-close”, wingman adds the runway to his scan and takes a small cut away from the lead to
land on the center of the opposite side of the runway while maintaining parade bearing. Use care to
ensure that drift away from the lead does not become excessive for the runway width. Remember,
flying a pure parade position allows 4 feet of wingtip clearance.
The wingman touches down first and decelerates on that half of the runway as an individual. Do not
attempt to brake in section. If lead must cross the wingman’s nose to clear the duty, the wingman calls
“clear” on comm 2 when at taxi speed and with at least 800 feet between aircraft. The lead stops after
clearing the runway and waits for the wingman to join for section taxi.
9.2 AIR REFUELING (RECEIVER)
Air refueling shall be conducted in accordance with NATO publication ATP-56, Air-to-Air Refueling
Procedures.
NOTE
The KC-10, KC-130, KC-135 tankers, F/A-18E/F and S-3 aircraft with
a 31-301 (A/A42R-1) buddy store are authorized tankers for air
refueling. Maximum refueling pressure is 55 psi.
9.2.1 Air Refueling Checklist. The air refueling checklist should be complete prior to plug-in.
1. RADAR - STBY/SILENT/EMCOM (″nose cold″)
2. MASTER ARM switch - SAFE (″switches safe″)
3. ALE-50 transmit power - OFF (if decoy deployed)
4. INTR WING switch - NORM (or as required)
5. EXT TANK switch(es) - AS DESIRED
If feed tank fuel level is critical, selecting STOP ensures the fastest transfer of fuel to the feed
tanks.
NOTE
For ARS configured aircraft: If fueling of the ARS is not desired
during aerial refueling, as the receiver, CTR ORIDE must be selected
since CTR STOP will not prevent fuel from entering the ARS.
Selecting CTR ORIDE will pressurize all external fuel tanks and
significantly reduce refueling rate.

6. PROBE switch - EXTEND
7. Visor - DOWN (recommended)
For night air refueling -
8. Exterior lights - SET FOR REFUELING
9. Tanker lights - REQUEST AS DESIRED
9.2.2 Refueling Technique. The following procedures, as applied to tanker operations, refer to single
drogue refueling from the F/A-18E/F and the aerial refueling store. All other tanking evolutions are
dependent on the type of tanker being utilized. Refer to Chapter 26, Visual Communications, for
proper hand signals during air refueling operations.
A sharp lookout doctrine must be maintained due to the precise flying imposed on both the tanker
and receiver pilots. Other aircraft in the formation may assist the tanker in maintaining a sharp
lookout. Refueling altitudes and airspeeds are dictated by receiver and/or tanker characteristics
balanced with operational needs. This typically covers a practical envelope from the surface to 40,000
feet and 180 to 300 KCAS (while engaged), depending on the buddy store part number. (See figure
4-13).
9.2.2.1 Approach. When cleared to commence an approach and the refueling checklist is complete,
assume a ready position 10 to 15 feet in trail of the drogue with the refueling probe in line both
horizontally and vertically. Once in a stabilized position, trim the aircraft and make sure the tanker
ready light (amber) is on. Referencing the probe and drogue for alignment, increase power to establish
a 3 to 5 knot closure rate.
• If the tanker ready light is not on, do not engage drogue until signaled
by tanker aircraft as hose-reel response may be inoperative, causing
damage to tanker and receiver aircraft.
• Avoid damage to the right AOA probe by contact with the basket as a
4 channel AOA failure may result.
• An excessive closure rate may cause a violent hose whip following
contact and/or increase the danger of structural damage to the aircraft
in the event of misalignment.
NOTE
An insufficient closure rate results in the pilot fencing with the drogue
as it oscillates in close proximity to the aircraft nose.
Make small corrections during the approach phase using the rudder pedals for lateral misalignment
and longitudinal stick for vertical misalignment. Avoid lateral stick inputs as they cause both vertical
and lateral probe displacement. During the final phase of the approach, the drogue has a tendency to
move up and to the right as it passes the nose of the receiver aircraft due to the aircraft-to-drogue air
stream interaction.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-9-6 ORIGINAL
9.2.2.2 Missed Approach. A missed approach is executed by reducing power and backing to the rear
with a 3 to 5 knot opening rate. Execute a missed approach if:
1. The receiver probe and the drogue basket cannot be properly aligned during the final phase of the
approach.
2. The receiver probe passes forward of the drogue basket.
3. The receiver probe impinges on the rim of the drogue basket.
4. Any unsafe condition develops.
Analyze alignment problems prior to commencing another approach.
9.2.2.3 Contact. When the receiver probe engages the basket, it seats itself into the reception
coupling and a slight ripple is evident in the refueling hose. The drogue and hose must be pushed
forward 5 feet by the receiver aircraft before fuel transfer can be started. This position is evident by
the tanker ready light (amber) going out and the (green) fuel transfer light (green) coming on. During
refueling, maintain a position directly behind and slightly below tanker aircraft.
NOTE
If streaming fuel is observed around the refueling probe, the probe is
not properly seated in the drogue. Disengage, stabilize in the ready
position, and then reengage the drogue.
9.2.2.4 Disengagement. The receiver aircraft disengages by reducing power in order to open from
the tanker at 3 to 5 knots. Back straight away and down, following the flight path of the tanker. The
receiver probe separates from the reception coupling when the hose reaches full extension. When clear
of the drogue, place the PROBE switch in the RETRACT position. Make sure that the PROBE UNLK
caution display is out before resuming normal flight operations.
• Disengagement must be made straight back, parallel to the tanker
flight path, and descending along the natural trail angle of the hose to
prevent damage to the tanker and/or refueling aircraft.
• When installed on the F/A-18 E/F tanker, the ARS hose/drogue/
coupling exhibits a strong tendency to re-center in its natural trail
position. Off-center disconnects may result in drogue contact and
damage to the aircraft. Avoid off-center disconnects and maintain a
constant separation rate until clear.
9.2.2.5 KC-10 Refueling Operations. The KC-10 tanker is equipped with a centerline hose reel
system and/or two Wing Aerial Refueling Pods (WARP). Maximum in-flight refueling airspeed and
altitude for the F/A-18E/F when refueling from the KC-10 is 275 KCAS and 25,000 feet with an
optimum airspeed of 220 KCAS. At airspeeds above 250 KCAS, tanker induced light turbulence causes
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-9-7 ORIGINAL
random drogue movement of 2 to 3 feet while 1 foot of movement will be encountered at airspeeds less
than 250 KCAS. The recommended closure rate is 2 to 3 knots.
When joining a flight of receiver aircraft, do not close astern of the KC-10
within 1 to 3 miles from co-altitude to 500 feet below. Loss of aircraft
control can occur if wake turbulence is encountered.
Excessive closure rates may exceed the capabilities of the take-up reel. If
this should happen, a sine wave develops in the hose. Immediate
disengagement is required to prevent damage to the aircraft.
9.2.2.6 KC-135 Refueling Operations. The KC-135 may be configured with a Multi-Point Refueling
System (MPRS) and/or a Boom to Drogue Adapter (BDA) kit.
9.2.2.6.1 KC-135 BDA Refueling. The KC-135 hose has a fixed length of 9 feet attached by a
swiveling coupling to the end of a telescoping boom. The hose terminates in a hard, non-collapsible
drogue and has no reel retraction capability. The following refueling parameters are recommended:
• Airspeed of 200 to 275 KCAS or Mach 0.8 (whichever is less).
• Closure rate of 2 knots or less.
Aerial refueling from the KC-135 is fundamentally different from the standard Navy hose-drogue
systems. After assuming a standard ready position, add power to create a closure rate of 2 knots or less.
Due to the short length of hose and the weight of the drogue, the aircraft-to-drogue air stream
interaction is minimized.
Excessive closure rates (greater than 2 knots) may result in damage to the
aircraft or the refueling drogue.
Once contact has been made, the drogue must be pushed in approximately 4 feet and held in that
position within ±2 feet fore and aft for fuel to flow (the hose forms a U-shape when in the correct
position). If the F/A-18E/F is positioned too far aft with the hose near the trail position, slight aft or
radial movement results in disconnect. The potentially more hazardous situation occurs when the
drogue is pushed too far forward, such that the hose could be looped around the drogue on the probe.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-9-8 ORIGINAL
When disengaging, align the drogue with the boom and back straight away with reference to the
boom.
Off-center disconnects can result in damage to the refueling probe or
nozzle because of the excessive sideloads generated by the KC-135
boom-drogue adapter.
9.2.2.6.2 KC-135 MPRS Refueling. The KC-135 MPRS incorporates the use of wing tip mounted
aerial refueling pods to support receivers designed for hose/drogue refueling operations. The refueling
hose is slightly shorter than the KC-130 and located near the wing tips. The extreme outboard wing
location subjects the hose and drogue to wing tip flowfield disturbances at higher refueling speeds.
• Maximum recommended refueling speed 285 KCAS (up to 300 KCAS/0.86 IMN allowed)
• Optimum refueling airspeeds 260 - 285 KCAS.
While flying at the approach position (20 ft aft of the drogue), small lateral trim inputs may be
required to counter a tendency to roll toward the tanker. Deviations inboard and outboard may require
additional lateral stick inputs. Deviations of more than 10 feet high can result in a strong sideslip (on
right tanker wing, full left ball). Light buffet is a good indication to reposition down with respect to the
tanker.
Maintaining a slow controlled constant closure rate (less than 5 knots) will result in the best
engagement results. Tanking at 300 knots is demanding due to increased bow wave effects and high
drogue position.
9.3 AIR REFUELING (TANKER)
Air refueling shall be conducted in accordance with NATO publication ATP-56, Air-To-Air
Refueling Procedures.
9.3.1 Air Refueling Store (ARS). The ARS is a missionized component for in-flight refueling. The
ARS control panel (figure 9-3) provides power, fuel transfer operation, fuel status indicators, BIT
status, and normal hose extension/retraction, and hose jettison capability.
Figure 9-3. ARS Control Panel
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-9-9 ORIGINAL
9.3.1.1 Power Switch (PWR). The PWR switch provides electrical and hydraulic power to the store.
NOTE
For the -4/-5 ARS stores, once powered on (220 KCAS min), airspeed
may be reduced to as slow as 180 KCAS to transfer fuel below 5,000 ft
MSL. Attempts to power on below 220 KCAS will be unsuccessful and
accelerating to 220 KCAS will not recover the RAT. Store power must
be turned off and airspeed increased to 220 KCAS or greater before
re-applying power.
ON Electrical power is routed in the store and the ram air turbine (RAT) unfeathers, which
provides hydraulic power.
OFF Feathers the RAT and removes electrical and hydraulic power.
DUMP Disabled and safety guarded.
NOTE
If the hose is extended, the PWR switch is bypassed (cannot be turned
OFF).
9.3.1.2 STORE Switch. The STORE switch controls fuel transfer between the store and tanker (own
aircraft).
FROM Pressurizes the store to transfer fuel from store to own aircraft.
OFF Depressurizes store.
TO Replenish ARS with own aircraft fuel.
9.3.1.3 REFUEL Display. The four digit display indicates fuel (in pounds) delivered or scheduled, a
three digit BIT code - when commanded, or a 0E when a serious malfunction occurs. The display
initially powers up with 2,500 lb scheduled.
9.3.1.4 Refuel RST Button. A momentary pushbutton that returns LBS scheduled or delivered to
original settings. Pounds scheduled returns to 2,500 pounds or previously scheduled quantity. Pounds
delivered returns to zero.
9.3.1.5 Refuel Data Display Switch. The refuel data display switch is a three position toggle switch
which is spring-loaded to the delivery (DEL) position. The switch can be toggled to the BIT CODE or
scheduled (SCH) positions.

SCH Pounds of fuel scheduled to be transferred. When scheduled point is reached, automatic
transfer is terminated. 2,500 lb automatically scheduled at power up.
9.3.1.6 Refuel SLEW Switch. The SLEW switch is a three position toggle switch which is springloaded to the center position. If the refuel data display switch is in the SCH position, moving the switch
up increases pounds of fuel scheduled for transfer, and down decreases the fuel scheduled for transfer.
In SCH, the SLEW switch moves the selected indications as follows:
1. 0 to 100 lb, 75 lb/sec in 25 lb increments
2. 100 to 1,000 lb, 300 lb/sec in 100 lb increments
3. >1,000 lb, 600 lb/sec in 200 lb increments
9.3.1.7 BITE Flag Indicator. The BITE flag indicator indicates failures in the control panel assembly.
9.3.1.8 ALERT Indicators. There are two ALERT lights on the right side of the ARS panel.
LOW
RESV
A red warning light illuminates when the hydraulic reservoir level drops below ½ full
and begins flashing when the reservoir level drops below ¼ full.
DUMP ARS DUMP is not functional.
9.3.1.9 HOSE CUT/SAFE Switch. The HOSE CUT/SAFE switch is a two position switch springloaded to the SAFE position and held in SAFE by a spring-loaded guard. The switch is wired through
the WonW interlock to prevent accidental activation on the deck.
SAFE Normal position.
CUT Refueling hose is cut and crimped. ARS is deactivated hydraulically and electrically. In
flight, the switch must be held for several seconds.
9.3.1.10 Dimming (BRT/DIM) Switch. The BRT/DIM switch controls the intensity of the receiver
pilot advisory lights on the ARS tailcone and control panel displays. BRT is used for day operations,
and DIM is used for night operations.
9.3.1.11 Status Lights. There are four status lights on the ARS control panel.
STOW Green light comes on when hose is approximately one foot from complete stowage. If
hose/drogue is not fully stowed, the indication is through a MASTER CAUTION and
aural tone, and the ARS DROGUE caution appears on the DDI.
RDY Green light illuminates when the hose is fully deployed and automatic hose response is
established.
PRESS Green light illuminates when hydraulic pressure drops below 1,700 psi. Light goes out
when pressure exceeds 2,000 psi.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-9-11 ORIGINAL
XFR Green light illuminates when a minimum of 20 gallons/min of fuel is being transferred
to the receiver.
9.3.1.12 TRANS Switch. The three position transfer switch is lever locked in the AUTO position and
controls fuel transfer to the receiver aircraft.
OVRD The ARS fuel pump is turned on regardless of hose position, fuel schedule, or fuel
remaining in the store. The OVRD position should only be used during emergency refueling situations.
AUTO When connected to receiver aircraft, fuel flows when the following conditions are met:
• The hose is within the refueling range (approximately 5 to 20 feet of full trail),
• ARS (fuel is above 175 pounds) is not low on fuel; and,
• The scheduled amount of fuel is not exceeded.
OFF Turns the pump off regardless of hose position.
9.3.1.13 HOSE Switch. The three position switch controls the hose reel. The HOSE switch lever locks
in the RETR and EXT positions and is spring-loaded to EXT from the RESET position.
RETR The hose retracts or remains retracted.
EXT The hose extends or remains extended.
RESET Reset is used to establish a new reference pressure (after release to EXT) when airspeed varies more than 10 KCAS from the last reference airspeed (either at extension
or at the time of the last RESET).
Do not select RESET when a receiver aircraft is plugged in. RESET
causes momentary loss of auto response and may damage receiver
aircraft.
Failure to reset hose reference pressure may result in hose auto retraction
if decelerating, or non-responsiveness if accelerating.
9.3.1.14 ARS DROGUE Caution. An ARS DROGUE caution on the DDI indicates that the ARS
PWR switch is OFF and the refueling drogue has not fully retracted.
9.3.2 ARS (Tanker) Procedures.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-9-12 ORIGINAL
9.3.2.1 Tanker Safety Precautions.
1. Do not extend the drogue when an ARS hydraulic leak is observed.
2. Do not actuate the speed brake function during any part of the refueling operation.
3. Single point failure of either the fuel/no air valve or ARS high level float sensor may result in fuel
discharge from the ARS vent during refueling as a receiver (ground or inflight). Inability to
transfer fuel from ARS to internal tanks, or failure to successfully complete pre-checks on ARS
prior to ground refueling (hot pit or truck), are indications of single point failures. If failures are
indicated, hot pit refueling and/or inflight refueling is prohibited.
NOTE
• When tanks 1 and 4 are empty, no more fuel can be transferred to the
ARS. With normal fuel transfer, this occurs at a normal aircraft fuel
state of 4,200 to 4,900 pounds.
• Anytime four external fuel tanks are loaded on wing stations (3, 4, 8,
and 9), selecting ORIDE on LI/RI external transfer switch will
improve dump performance and external transfer rate by commanding
simultaneous transfer of all external tanks vs. normal transfer
sequence (tanks on Stations 3/9 must be empty prior to tanks on
Stations 4/8 transferring). Performing this function imposes airspeed
limitations defined in Figure 4-12.
4. Avoid use of barometric altitude hold in turbulent conditions or whenever receiver is having
difficulty achieving basket contact.

the previously scheduled amount when the switch is in the DEL position.
The TRANS switch should always be in the AUTO position for normal
fuel transfer. The OVRD position is an emergency condition that
overrides normal system operation and provides fuel flow regardless of
hose position.
9.3.2.7 Receiver Hook-up and Refueling. Ater the receiver aircraft engages and moves forward into
the refueling range, the store amber RDY light extinguishes. Fuel transfer commences if the FUEL
TRANS switch is in the AUTO position. The green XFR light illuminates when the transfer rate is 20
gallons per minute or higher.
9.3.2.8 Stopping Fuel Transfer. The receiver aircraft receives fuel until one of the following occurs:
1. The IFR probe disengages.
2. The receiver aircraft moves out past the fueling range outer limit, approximately 5 feet from full
trail (the amber ready light comes on).
3. The receiver aircraft moves in past the refueling range inner limit, approximately 25 feet from full
trail (the amber ready light flashes).
• Refueling cannot be stopped by placing the PWR switch to OFF with
the hose extended.
• Lack of hydraulic pressure causes a loss of hose response resulting in
hose instability and a potential hose whip incident. If either the red
PRESS or LOW RESV light comes on, aerial refueling should be
terminated and the hose retracted.
Transfer of fuel to the aerial refueling store continues until one of the following occurs:
1. ARS TRANS switch is placed to OFF.
2. The BINGO caution comes on.
3. Tanks 1 and 4 are empty (with normal fuel transfer, this occurs at a fuel state of approximately
5,000 pounds of fuel). The FQTY advisory comes on.
9.3.2.9 Emergency Fuel Transfer. If problems are encountered in obtaining fuel transfer from the
store to the receiver aircraft, a system is provided that bypasses some normal switch functions to
provide fuel transfer. After the receiver is engaged in the coupling, turn the TRANS switch to OVRD.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-9-16 ORIGINAL
This switch provides power to open the shutoff valve and energize the priority valve to allow hydraulic
flow to the fuel pump motor, and bypasses the low level switch and the fuel flow range switches.
• The receiver aircraft should not attempt engagement when the switch
is in OVRD since there will be fuel pressure in the coupling that
increases the force required to make an engagement. The force will be
above that which provides adequate hose response and a damaging
hose whip may result.
• The TRANS switch should be moved from OVRD to OFF prior to the
receiver disconnecting. Fuel pressure in the coupling increases the
disconnect forces by 200 pounds above normal. Momentary fuel spray
may also occur.
NOTE
The TRANS switch should be taken out of the OVRD position if the
green XFR light on the ARS control panel extinguishes.
9.3.2.10 Drogue Retraction.
1. TRANS switch - OFF
2. Airspeed - Refer to ARS operating limitations, figure 4-13.
Field arrestment or carrier landing with the drogue extended is not
recommended. Guillotine (HOSE - CUT) drogue in clear or uninhabited
areas.
3. HOSE switch - RETR
4. When the white STOW light illuminates, and the HOSE advisory clears, PWR switch - OFF
9.3.2.11 Transfer Fuel from ARS to Tanker (Own Ship). If it is desired to transfer fuel from the
refueling store, do the following:
1. STORE switch - FROM
9.3.2.12 Before Landing.
1. STORE switch - OFF
2. HOSE switch - RETR
3. BIT codes - CHECK

9.3.4 ARS Limitations.
Refer to Chapter 4, Operating Limitations.
9.4 NIGHT VISION DEVICE (NVD) OPERATIONS
9.4.1 Effects on Vision. Flight techniques and visual cues used during unaided night flying also apply
to flying with night vision devices (NVD). The advantage of NVD is improved ground reference
provided through image intensifier systems (NVG/NAVFLIR). Dark adoption is unnecessary for the
effective viewing through night vision goggles (NVG). In fact, viewing through the NVG for a short
period of time shortens the normal dark adaptation period. After using NVG, an average individual
requires 1 to 3 minutes to reach the 30 minute dark adaptation level. Color discrimination is absent
when viewing the NVG image. The image is seen in a monochromatic green hue and is less distinct than
normal vision. Prolonged usage may result in visual illusions upon removal of the NVG. These illusions
include complement or green after-images when viewing contrasting objects. Illusions from NVG are
temporary and normal physiological phenomena and the length of time the effects last vary with the
individual.
• Aircrew are strongly cautioned against maneuvering above 3g with the
AN/AVS-9 in the up-locked (not in use but on helmet) position
because the NVD bracket cannot retain AN/AVS-9 under elevated
loads.
• Ejection wearing Night Vision Goggles is not recommended. Severe
neck injury may result.
9.4.2 Effects of Light. Any non-NVG compatible light source in the cockpit degrades the ability to
see with NVG. Filters are used to prevent stray or scattered light from reaching the NVG intensifiers,
which would cause the automatic gain control to reduce the NVG image intensification. Head down
displays (DDI, MPCD) are filtered to allow non-electrical-optical viewing of the display. Viewing areas
illuminated by artificial light sources with NVG (runway/landing lights, flares, or aircraft position
lights) limit the ability to see objects outside of the area.
NOTE
Bright ground lights may cause loss of ground references during
landing. Avoid looking directly at bright light sources to prevent
degrading NVG vision.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-9-18 ORIGINAL
The NAVFLIR is not affected by light sources and complements NVG use.
9.4.3 Weather Conditions. NAVFLIR and NVG provide a limited capability to see through visibility
restrictions such as fog, rain, haze, and certain types of smoke. As the density of the visibility
restrictions increases, a gradual reduction in light occurs. Use of an offset scanning technique will help
in alerting the pilot to severe weather conditions.
NOTE
Visibility restrictions produce a ‘‘halo’’ effect around artificial lights.
9.4.4 Object/Target Detection. Detection ranges are largely a function of atmospheric and environmental conditions. Moving targets with contrasting backgrounds or targets with a reflected or
generated light or heat sources can be identified at greater ranges when using NVD.
9.4.5 Flight Preparation. Flights with NVD require unique planning considerations that include
weather, moon phase/angle, illumination, ground terrain and shadowing effects. Tactical consideration
and procedures can be found in the Night Attack operational tactics guides (OTG).
9.5 SHORT AIRFIELD FOR TACTICAL SUPPORT (SATS) PROCEDURES
9.5.1 Landing Pattern. Approach the break point either individually or in echelon, parade formation,
at 250 KIAS. A 17 to 20 second break interval provides a 35 to 40 second touchdown interval. The
landing checklist should be completed and the aircraft should be at on-speed AOA/approach speed by
the 180° position.
9.5.2 Approach. Plan for and execute an on-speed approach. Pay particular attention to maintaining
the proper airspeed and correct lineup.
9.5.3 Waveoff. To execute a waveoff, immediately add full power and maintain optimum attitude.
Make all waveoffs straight ahead until clear of the landing area.
9.5.4 Arrested Landing. The aircraft should be on runway centerline at touchdown. Aircraft
alignment should be straight down the runway, with no drift. Upon touchdown, maintain the throttle
at the approach position. When arrestment is assured, retard the throttle to idle. Allow the aircraft to
roll back to permit the hook to disengage from the pendant. When directed by the taxi director, apply
both brakes to stop the rollback and raise the hook. If further rollback is directed, release brakes and
allow the aircraft to be pulled back until a brake signal is given. Apply brakes judiciously to prevent
the aircraft from tipping or rocking back.
Use extreme caution when taxiing on a wet SATS runway.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-9-19 ORIGINAL
9.5.5 Bolter. Bolters are easily accomplished. Simultaneously apply full power and retract the
arresting gear hook. Smoothly rotate the aircraft to a lift-off attitude and fly away.
• Bolters in GAIN ORIDE or with AOA failed require positive aft stick
during rotation, 1/2 aft stick is recommended. Deflections of less than
1/2 aft stick will result in excessive settle during bolters.
• If landing on a runway with a SATS catapult installed, care must be
taken to prevent engagement of the dolly arrester ropes with the
aircraft tailhook. Structural damage to the aircraft and catapult will
result.

CHAPTER 10
Functional Checkflight Procedures
10.1 GENERAL
The intent of functional checks is to determine whether the airframe, power plant, accessories, and
equipment are functioning per predetermined standards. The unique electronic built-in test (BIT),
fault detection, and fault isolation capabilities of the F/A-18E/F allow functional checks that have
historically been performed inflight to be performed on the ground. In general, engine control and
flight control system faults are reliably detected, annunciated, and, in most cases, functionally
bypassed by the aircraft control systems.
In most cases, functional checks for the F/A-18E/F will be performed on the ground by maintenance
personnel based on the requirements set forth in the maintenance work package for the component
being removed, replaced, and/or installed and not by a pilot on a dedicated FCF. Required
maintenance ground checks take advantage of the aircraft’s BIT and fault detection capability and
ensure the health of the component and the integrity of the installation.
10.1.1 Engine Functional Checks. Based on the engine component replaced, ground functional test
requirements for the engine may include any or all of the following: idle speed test (low power turn);
air, oil, fuel leak test (leak check); anti-ice test; MIL power test; MIN AB test; MAX power test (high
power turn); transient test; and/or shutdown test. For instance, a single engine removal/reinstallation,
a single engine replacement, or a dual engine removal/reinstallation requires a low power turn and a
leak check. A dual engine replacement requires a low power turn, leak check, and high power turn. A
FADEC replacement requires ALL functional checks. Additionally, a crossbleed start is required on all
engine reinstallations and replacements. Given the FADEC’s fault detection capability, successfully
completing these functional checks ensures that the engine is properly installed and is functioning
normally. All engine functionality that would be checked inflight is checked during the required
ground checks. Dedicated FCFs are, therefore, not required following engine related maintenance
actions.
10.1.2 Flight Control System Functional Checks. Functional test requirements for the aircraft FCS
include electronic rigging, an FCS maintenance BIT, and a test group (TG) for the specific actuator or
surface which was reinstalled or replaced. The FCS maintenance BIT requires operator intervention
and is the most comprehensive test of the FCS. The FCS maintenance BIT also performs unique tests
to verify the proper installation of a system component. Successfully completing these functional
checks ensures that all surfaces and actuators are properly installed and the FCS is functioning
normally.
Generally, dedicated FCFs are not required following actuator/surface related maintenance actions.
An exception involves the replacement of a LEF hydraulic drive unit (HDU). It is possible for a weak
LEF HDU to pass ground checks yet fail to drive the LEF to the proper position when the surface is
subjected to air loads. A weak HDU may manifest itself by a LEF split, a FLAP SCHED caution,
and/or a possible roll off. Therefore, following the replacement of a LEF HDU, a series of inflight
functional checks are required to test the new component at flight conditions that safely detect weak
HDUs.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-10-1 ORIGINAL
10.1.3 Landing Gear Functional Checks. Ground functional test requirements for the landing gear
system include the following: aircraft jack, LDG GEAR handle mechanical stop and DOWNLOCK
ORIDE button test, landing gear warning light and warning tone test, normal landing gear extension
and retraction, planing link failure test, and emergency landing gear extension (front and rear cockpits
in the F/A-18F). Successfully completing these functional checks ensures that the normal and
emergency landing gear systems are functioning normally. While a dedicated FCF is not required
following landing gear related maintenance, an airborne functional check of the emergency landing
gear system may nonetheless be desired. An airborne functional check, coded E, has been included to
perform this test, at the discretion of the Maintenance Officer, on a ″pro and go″ (FCF combined with
but before operational flight) basis.
10.2 FCF REQUIREMENTS
Figure 10-1 lists the FCF requirements for the F/A-18E/F. Where appropriate, functional checks are
grouped by system and are coded with a letter, A thru E, to identify the type of FCF profile to be flown.
These letter codes appear next to each required item or groups of items in the FCF checklist.
COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2 Series allows an FCF to be flown in combination with operational
flights at the discretion of the Commanding Officer, provided the operational portion is not conducted
until the FCF requirements have been completed and entered on the FCF checklist. Generally, a
profile ‘‘A’’ FCF is flown as a dedicated flight due to the number of required checks. However, due to
the limited number of required checks, profile ‘‘C’’ and ‘‘E’’ FCFs, as well as profile ‘‘D’’ FCFs required
solely by the reconfiguration of the rear cockpit, can be flown and are recommended to be flown as ‘‘pro
and go’s.’’
10.3 FCF QUALIFICATIONS
Aircrew who perform FCFs shall be qualified per OPNAVINST 3710.7 and must be designated in
writing by the Squadron Commanding Officer. For a profile ‘‘A’’ FCF, the complete FCF checklist shall
be utilized. For a profile ‘‘C’’ or ‘‘E’’ FCF, a special, abbreviated FCF checklist has been created which
incorporates only those checks required for a ‘‘C’’ and ‘‘E’’ profile. Prior to flight, FCF aircrew must
familiarize themselves with the FCF checklists and the specific functional checks required for the given
profile.
Historically, FCF checklists have only included FCF checks. To reduce confusion and provide a more
coherent checklist, the FCF checks presented in this chapter have been interleaved into the normal
NATOPS checklist. Specific FCF requirements are, therefore, highlighted in italics in this chapter and
in the FCF checklist which is utilized inflight. Additionally, check-off blocks, provided on the FCF
checklist, appear next to those items required by the FCF and not next to non-FCF, normal procedure,
items.
The FCF checklist shall be properly completed and promptly returned to Maintenance Control at
the completion of the FCF.
10.4 FCF PROCEDURES
FCFs shall be conducted with the minimum crew necessary to ensure proper operation of all
required equipment. FCF aircrew shall be given a thorough preflight briefing, coordinated by
Maintenance Control and given by appropriate QA and work center personnel. The briefing shall
describe maintenance performed, the requirements for that particular flight, and the expected results.
FCFs shall be performed using the applicable FCF checklist. The procedures contained in the FCF
checklist are presented in a recommended order. While the order of these functional checks may be
altered as required, the sequence of steps listed for any procedure is mandatory.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
III-10-2 ORIGINAL
If an FCF profile cannot be completed on a single flight due to time, fuel, operating area restrictions,
or other limiting factors, it is permissible to complete the remaining checks on a subsequent flight. This
subsequent flight may be flown by a different pilot, provided there is a thorough passdown, either
verbal or written, between the pilots.
Profile Type of Checks/Requirements
A Complete FCF profile
• Completion of SDLM, to be conducted by the rework facility.
• Acceptance of a newly assigned aircraft or upon receipt of an aircraft returned
from SDLM.
• Return to flight status of an aircraft that has not flown in 30 or more days.
• At the discretion of the Maintenance Officer (e.g., return to flight status of an
aircraft that has been excessively cannibalized).
NOTE
In an F/A-18F (missionized configuration), an FCF qualified
rear cockpit crewmember is required unless the Maintenance
Officer determines that the maintenance actions performed
do not require one.
B Engine/FADEC/fuel control
• Not required.
C LEF Checks
• Removal/reinstallation or replacement of a LEF HDU.
D Rear cockpit checks of an F/A-18F (trainer configuration only)
• Acceptance of a newly assigned aircraft or upon receipt of an aircraft returned
from SDLM.
• Reconfiguration from missionized to trainer configuration.
NOTE
Aft crewmember is required.
E Emergency landing gear extension
• At the discretion of the Maintenance Officer (e.g., following extensive maintenance on the landing gear system).

CHAPTER 11
Flight Characteristics
11.1 HANDLING QUALITIES.
The F/A-18E/F flight control system (FCS) is designed to present handling qualities that provide
virtually carefree maneuvering of the aircraft throughout most of the flight envelope. As such, there are
some flight characteristics which are somewhat unique to the F/A-18E/F airplane. A thorough
understanding of these flight characteristics along with the details of the flight control system
described in Chapter 2 and the operating limitations detailed in Chapter 4, allows the pilot to safely
and effectively exploit the full capabilities of the airplane.
11.1.1 Flight Control Mode Effects on Handling Qualities. Handling qualities are dependent on
which mode the flight control system is operating. FCS mode is determined primarily by the FLAP
switch position: power approach (PA) mode with the FLAP switch in HALF or FULL or up/auto (UA)
mode with the FLAP switch in AUTO. However, if airspeed is above approximately 240 KCAS, the
flight controls switches to, or remains in, UA mode regardless of FLAP switch position. FCS control
laws are also designed to minimize transients when switching flight control modes.
11.1.2 Handling Qualities with Flaps HALF or FULL. The FCS employs full-time AOA and pitch rate
feedback with flaps HALF or FULL. Therefore, longitudinal trim is required to maintain constant
AOA and/or airspeed. Once trimmed to an AOA, the aircraft tends to remain at that AOA until
changed by longitudinal stick or trim. The stick force gradient with AOA is constant up to 12° AOA
and does not vary with aircraft gross weight or center of gravity. Above 12° AOA, increased AOA
feedback increases stick forces as an artificial stall warning cue. Handling qualities are excellent up to
the 14° AOA limit. Maximum AOA at full aft stick with flaps HALF or FULL is approximately 25°
AOA. However, due to degraded handling qualities and reduced departure resistance above 15° AOA,
particularly with abrupt inputs, flight at greater than 14° AOA with flaps HALF or FULL is
prohibited.
The FCS provides good lateral directional control of the aircraft. The rolling surface to rudder
interconnect (RSRI) function along with sideslip and sideslip rate feedback are used to coordinate
lateral inputs, reducing pilot workload by allowing feet-on-floor maneuvering for most situations.
11.1.2.1 Stalls with Flaps HALF or FULL. The aircraft does not exhibit a classic stall break with flaps
HALF or FULL and both configurations are very departure resistant up to the 14° AOA limit for
normal two-engine operation, even with symmetric and asymmetric store loadings (see Single Engine
Operation). Roll and yaw control remain positive up to the 14° AOA limit in either flap setting but is
better above 10° AOA with flaps HALF. With flaps FULL, a distinct longitudinal buffet is felt at or
above 11 to 12° AOA which serves as a stall warning cue. This buffet tends to be more pronounced at
heavier gross weights and with wing tank loadings but does not adversely affect climb performance or
handling qualities. Above the AOA limit, uncontrollable roll-offs are possible in either flap setting,
particularly with high lateral weight asymmetry store loadings. An intermittent warning tone will
sound beginning at 14° AOA with an increasing beep frequency as AOA increases up to full aft stick.
11.1.2.2 Takeoff and Landing. Low gain nosewheel steering (NWS) incorporates yaw rate feedback
to stabilize directional control during the takeoff and landing roll. Maintaining runway position
without NWS using differential braking alone may be difficult. Crosswinds have minimal effect on
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-1 ORIGINAL
takeoff characteristics and only a small amount of lateral stick into the wind is required to keep the
wings level during the takeoff roll. Nosewheel lift-off speeds are dependent on CG location and aircraft
gross weight. At nominal and forward CG locations, the airplane requires aft stick to effect rotation.
Premature aft stick application during the takeoff roll can result in early nosewheel lift-off and
potential over-rotation, particularly with aft CG.
• Pitch attitudes in excess of 10° during takeoff rotation may result in
ground contact between engine exhaust nozzles and/or stabilators.
• With combinations of heavy gross weight, forward CG, high density
altitudes and late takeoff rotation, ground speed can exceed the
maximum nose gear tire speed of 195 knots ground speed (see
NATOPS performance charts).
Additionally, landing gear speed limits can be easily exceeded during shallow climbs after takeoff
with MAX power.
With large lateral weight asymmetries, there is a slight tendency to yaw into the heavy wing during
the initial ground roll and again during the takeoff rotation. Otherwise, takeoff characteristics are very
similar to symmetric store loadings. Directional trim may be required after takeoff for balanced flight
with store asymmetries. A small lateral-directional transient may occur during configuration changes
from flaps HALF to AUTO or from flaps AUTO to HALF. The lateral transient occurs since TEFs are
deflected differentially for lateral control with flaps AUTO and the additional lateral control results in
an associated directional transient due to the rolling-surface-to-rudder interconnect.
Normal approach and landing characteristics are excellent; with good speed stability and solid
lateral-directional handling qualities. With crosswinds, a wings-level crabbed approach with removal of
half the crab angle just prior to touchdown minimizes deviations from runway heading and landing
gear side loads during landings. Touchdown in a full crab angle results in an uncomfortable roll
opposite the crab angle and upwind drift, requiring large rudder pedal inputs to align the aircraft with
the runway. Likewise, removing the crab angle entirely results in downwind drift and directional
transients after touchdown. A wing down, top rudder approach results in excessive bank angle and is
not recommended.
With flaps HALF or FULL, handling qualities with large lateral weight asymmetries are virtually
identical to those with symmetric loadings; however, landing with crosswinds from the heavy wing side
results in less roll away from the wind at touchdown. With large lateral asymmetries, the aircraft will
fly with the heavy wing forward. Upon landing the aircraft will yaw into the heavy wing as the aircraft
straightens to its ground track. Once airborne on a touch and go or bolter, the aircraft will yaw away
from the heavy wing as the aircraft trims to a heavy wing forward position. Regardless of wind
conditions, the aircraft tends to yaw away from the heavy wing during periods of heavy braking but the
yaw is easily countered with a small rudder pedal input.
11.1.3 Flaps AUTO Handling Qualities. The FCS control laws create handling qualities that are
slightly different from aircraft with conventional flight control systems. The most apparent characteristics are the neutral speed stability at low AOA and the excellent maneuverability at high AOA.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-2 ORIGINAL
Neutral speed stability occurs since the FCS automatically attempts to keep the aircraft in 1g, zero
pitch rate flight. This has the effect of eliminating the need for frequent longitudinal trim adjustments,
lowering pilot workload for most tasks; however, some tasks are made slightly more difficult. For
example, during large airspeed changes, the aircraft may initially appear to be slightly out of trim for
a few seconds until FCS re-establishes 1g flight. Since pitch trim biases the FCS away from 1g flight,
any pitch trim used during large airspeed changes must be removed within a few seconds of
establishing the new airspeed and only adds workload. Additionally, during climbs or dives, a small but
constant forward stick force is required to maintain a constant pitch attitude and load factor. Again,
if pitch trim is used to eliminate these stick forces, additional short trim inputs will be required to
re-establish 1g flight, further increasing pilot workload. Another task with a slightly increased
workload is the instrument penetration/approach where neutral speed stability may cause difficulty in
maintaining a desired airspeed.
The longitudinal handling qualities are excellent with good pitch rate and damping that combine to
allow very aggressive maneuvering. FCS control laws modify aircraft response to stick inputs, creating
the effect of changing stick forces to provide pilot cueing in maneuvering flight. Actual stick forces for
a given stick displacement do not change with flight condition. Full forward and aft stick requires a 20-
pound push and 37-pound pull, respectively. At high airspeeds, the FCS is a g-command system
requiring 3.5 pounds of stick force per g. At medium airspeeds, the FCS acts as a hybrid pitch rate and
g-command system. Pitch rate feedback is used to increase apparent stick force per g as a cue of
decaying airspeed and available load factor. At low airspeed, the FCS is primarily an AOA command
system using AOA feedback above 22° to provide increasing stick force with increasing AOA. The
maximum commanded AOA is approximately 45° to 50° at full aft stick. Combined with the capability
to command high AOA is the ability to generate high nose-down pitch rates with large forward stick to
rapidly reduce AOA, particularly below approximately 200 KCAS. This nose-down pitch rate
capability is further enhanced as airspeed decreases to 150 KCAS. When airspeed is below 150 KCAS
and longitudinal stick is pushed far forward (greater than 1.7 inches), up to full stabilator, maximum
rudder flare-out, and LEX spoiler are commanded to rapidly get the aircraft nose moving down. This
FCS feature was added to enable pilots to rapidly reduce AOA when at low airspeed and high AOA for
quick nose repositioning. To maintain departure resistance, the enhanced nose-down pitch rate
capability is reduced when lateral stick is deflected more than one inch.
The g-limiter function in the FCS limits commanded load factor under most flight conditions to the
symmetric load limit (NzREF) based on gross weight below 57,400 pounds gross weight. Above 57,400
pounds, NzREF is held constant at 5.5g even though the allowable load factor may be below NzREF
(refer to G-Limiter). Above 57,400 pounds gross weight, the g-limiter does not provide adequate over-g
protection and pilot action may be required to prevent an aircraft overstress.
Very abrupt full aft stick commands with aft CG conditions can beat the g-limiter and cause a
positive over-g (811 MSP code). Likewise, very abrupt pushes can result in a negative over-g (925 MSP
code). Care should be taken during all abrupt maneuvers. During rolling maneuvers, the g-limiter also
reduces commanded load factor to 80% of NzREF. This feature can also be defeated with abrupt
lateral stick inputs at elevated-g. Abrupt full lateral stick inputs at NzREF may result in an aircraft
overstress without setting an 811 or 925 over-g MSP code (see figure 4-7, Acceleration Limits - Basic
Aircraft, Note 2).
Another flight characteristic related to g-limiter performance occurs during very high bleed rate
turns where even with full aft stick, load factor may be slightly less than NzREF. This can happen when
the aircraft decelerates much faster than the FCS can position the stabilators to maintain NzREF.
Additionally, during elevated-g maneuvering at transonic flight conditions, the g-limiter unloads the
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-3 ORIGINAL
aircraft (and NzREF) by as much as 1.0 to 1.7g. This feature helps prevent an aircraft overstress that
could result from the classic aerodynamic phenomenon known as ‘‘transonic pitch-up’’ experienced
during elevated-g decelerations at transonic flight conditions.
At low angles of attack, the aircraft is extremely smooth with little sensation of changing airspeed
or Mach. However, at transonic flight conditions, the aircraft may exhibit a mild buffet, which is more
pronounced with empty wing pylons or interdiction loadings but is almost nonexistent with clean
wings. Buffet begins at approximately 0.88M, subsides by 0.95M, and presents a sensation much like
riding on a ″gravel road″. Airframe buffet is also noticeable in the cockpit while maneuvering at tactical
speeds between approximately 6° and 11° AOA. At low altitudes, this AOA range begins at
approximately 6g but at high altitude begins at 2g to 3g. Above this AOA range, the buffet sensation
at the cockpit subsides slightly but is still apparent in the airframe. Although this buffet at elevated-g
is present in all configurations, it is most apparent with empty wing pylons at transonic flight
conditions. Additionally, persistent but bounded wing rock or roll-off may occur at some flight
conditions if the maneuvers linger in the 8 to 13° AOA range. Gun tracking is still good in the presence
of buffet but workload is slightly increased. Formation flight in the buffet AOA region also exhibits a
slightly higher workload.
The speedbrake function provides very good deceleration capability at subsonic flight conditions.
Deploying the speedbrake function results in a small nose-up transient; a small nose-down transient
during retraction. These transients still allow the speedbrake function to be used comfortably during
formation flight. With speedbrake function fully deployed, the aircraft may feel sloppy in the yaw axis
during large rudder pedal inputs due to one rudder stalling. With lateral weight asymmetries, a small
sideforce may also be apparent when deploying the speedbrake function. At most supersonic flight
conditions up to Mach 1.5, the spoilers are the only active speedbrake surface due to limited
effectiveness of the other surfaces. Deceleration capability is still adequate with throttles at IDLE; with
one exception. When less than MIL thrust is selected above Mach 1.23, the engine fan speed lockup
feature (to prevent engine inlet instability) maintains MIL thrust levels, which has the side effect of
limiting deceleration capability until fan speed lockup deactivates at Mach 1.18.
Lateral-directional handling qualities are also excellent, particularly at high AOA. Roll rates and roll
damping combine to provide very agile roll control. The FCS attempts to maintain consistent roll
response throughout the 1g flight envelope. Additionally, rolling surface to rudder interconnects
coordinate lateral inputs, reducing pilot workload by allowing feet on the floor maneuvering under
most circumstances. Maximum roll rates are in the 200 to 225°/second range with clean wings and
approximately 130 to 150°/second with wing tanks and/or air-to-ground stores. Flight tests with wing
tank loadings demonstrated a very localized drop in maximum roll rate of approximately 50°/second
at Mach 0.92 to Mach 0.93, most notably at 20,000 feet. The FCS reduces maximum roll rate by 40 to
60°/second at high subsonic airspeeds and low altitudes (approximately Mach 0.90 below 10,000 ft),
due to structural load concerns. For additional structural loads concerns during negative-g rolls,
maximum roll rate capability is reduced to approximately 60 to 80°/second above approximately 550
KCAS.
The most obvious lateral-directional characteristic is the excellent maneuverability at high AOA as
a direct result of specific FCS high AOA control laws. At 25° AOA and above, rudder pedal deflections
no longer provide yaw control inputs but instead act entirely as a roll control (identical to lateral stick
input) by commanding aileron and differential stabilator with the RSRI commanding the required
rudder deflection for roll coordination. Rudder pedal inputs are summed with lateral stick inputs and
this combined input is limited to a value equal to a full lateral stick input. Therefore, applying pedal
opposite to lateral stick cancels lateral stick inputs proportional to the pedal input, i.e., full opposite
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-4 ORIGINAL
pedal cancels a full lateral stick command resulting in zero roll rate. Between 13° and 25° AOA, rudder
pedal deflections gradually change from pure yaw controllers to pure roll controllers. This method of
control provides enhanced departure resistance at high AOA.
Some traditional yaw control with rudder pedal is returned at low airspeed and high AOA only when
the pilot applies lateral stick and rudder in the same direction. This feature is effective only at
airspeeds below 225 KCAS and between 25° and 40° AOA. During flight tests, the most effective
pirouette initiation was found at approximately 200 KCAS and 35° AOA (18E-006 and subsequent).
Enabling this feature outside of these conditions would compromise departure resistance. When this
feature is enabled, the sum of lateral stick and rudder pedal command is no longer limited to a value
equal to a full lateral stick input. The excess roll command is fed to the directional axis to command
sideslip. For example, adding full rudder pedal with a full lateral stick input provides a maximum roll
and yaw command. Alternatively, adding lateral stick to an existing full rudder pedal input has the
same effect. The resulting aircraft motion is a highly controllable nose-high to nose-low reversal.
Small lateral trim variances may occur without significant changes in airspeed, AOA, or Mach
number. These variances result from small changes in internal or external wing tank fuel asymmetry
and may require more frequent lateral trim inputs. Lateral trim changes may also be required as flight
conditions change with asymmetric store loadings or if one or more flight control surfaces are slightly
out of rig. Additionally, small sideslip excursions (1 to 3°) are common during steep climbs and
descents, even with symmetric store loadings. These excursions are non-oscillatory in nature and are
controllable with minimal rudder pedal inputs.
In general, flying qualities are also very good with large lateral weight asymmetries. The aircraft
tends to roll toward the heavy wing at elevated g such as during a pull off target during an air-to-ground
attack; away from the heavy wing at negative g. In each case, the roll is easily countered with lateral
stick. Additionally, roll coordination may be slightly degraded with large lateral stick inputs and may
require rudder pedal to maintain balanced flight. At high AOA, the aircraft tends to yaw away from the
heavy wing. Yaw-off should be expected above 25° AOA. Opposite rudder pedal may be required to
maintain controlled flight.
11.1.4 FLIR Carriage Handling Qualities. Flight characteristics with a single ATFLIR or TFLIR pod
produce roll-off in the direction of the pod of up to 12°/second at transonic (Mach 0.90 to Mach 1.05)
Mach numbers. Above Mach 1.05, the roll-off becomes less and eventually reverses direction above
Mach 1.15. Above Mach 0.90, sizable lateral and directional trim settings are required when changing
Mach number, when greater than Mach 0.90, to reduce roll-off and large side forces. Additionally,
lateral inputs are required under elevated load factor in order to maintain the same roll attitude. This
roll-off phenomenon is dominated by the aerodynamic asymmetry, not the lateral weight asymmetry.
Carriage of the following reduces or eliminates the roll-off tendency. During flight test, empty
inboard SUU-79 pylons reduced the aerodynamic asymmetry by 50%. Carriage of symmetric pods
(ATFLIR or TFLIR on station 5 and NAVFLIR on station 7) effectively canceled the aerodynamic
asymmetry. A 480-gallon external fuel tank on the centerline also reduced the aerodynamic asymmetry
to nearly zero. The influence of an ARS was not flight tested but is expected to reduce the roll-off
tendency. Empty SUU-79 pylons on the midboard stations displayed a slight improvement. An
AIM-120 on the opposite fuselage station was ineffective in reducing the roll-off.
The magnitude of the roll-off at peak conditions (Mach 0.95) can be trimmed out, however, slight
variations in Mach require large variations in both lateral and directional trim settings to maintain
balanced flight. This additional pilot workload should be considered during low altitude flight where
mission crosscheck time is critical.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-5 ORIGINAL
During flight simulation, level bomb deliveries (using the ATFLIR for target identification and
refinement) were flown in a simulated night environment with no outside visual reference. Uncommanded roll-off appeared as a rotating FLIR image similar to what is displayed during over flight of
the designated target. It is possible that uncommanded aircraft bank angle changes, seen as a rotating
FLIR image through the sensor, may be confused with the rotating image that results from target over
flight.
Uncommanded roll-off during heads down sensor operation may result in
an unusual aircraft attitude, disorientation, altitude loss, and possible
CFIT.
11.1.5 5-Wet (4-EFT and ARS) Loading Handling Qualities. The 5-Wet tanker loading handling
characteristics are unique given the very high aircraft gross weight and considerable aerodynamic
influence (in particular, drag) of the external stores.
Ground handling qualities are excellent although higher throttle settings can be expected to initiate
aircraft movement. Additionally, heavy gross weights require noticeable long braking distances even
during routine taxi evolutions.
Throughout most of the 5-Wet envelope, aircraft handling characteristics are excellent. The heavy
gross weight and aerodynamic influence of the external fuel tanks result in a more sluggish aircraft
response to control inputs in all axes. This characteristic is the most noticeable during in-flight
refueling as a receiver. Control inputs during receiver tanking should be small and deliberate. High
frequency, ″last ditch″ inputs should be avoided. Larger throttle inputs are required to initiate aircraft
closure; however, the heavier aircraft weight requires considerable power reductions to arrest closure
rates. In-flight tanking engagements should target 2-3 KCAS closure (see NATOPS Flight Manual
Performance Data, A1-F18EA-NFM-200, Chapter 7, In-flight Refueling). As fuel is received, the
change in gross weight may be dramatic. The 5-wet loading has the largest fuel fraction (ratio of fuel
weight to total weight) of all loadings. As the total aircraft weight increases, the power required for level
flight will increase. When operating at high gross weights (>64,000 lb) and slow 1 g flight conditions
(<200 KCAS), AOA approaches the 15° limit. In this flight regime, the aircraft response may be more
sluggish, but still safe. Taking into account the human factors associated with the refueling task and
ARS operations (e.g. increased head-in-cockpit demands), difficulty of flying near the AOA limit is
compounded. Pay particular attention to the task in this flight regime. Small momentary excursions
above the AOA limit (15°) will not cause departure from controlled flight.
11.1.5.1 5-Wet Loading with 5-Wet FCC Gains not Set. Flying the aircraft with fuel tanks on the
midboard stations causes the mission computer to request that the flight control system use 5-Wet
control law gains to optimize flying qualities. The logic for this determination is absent from
H1E−031U/032U MC OFP and therefore causes the aircraft to always fly without the 5-Wet control
laws even if there are tanks on the midboard stations. For this case, where midboard tanks are installed
and H1E−031U/032U is installed, there may be some looseness in the flaps AUTO longitudinal flying
qualities at certain localized flight conditions, but this is not considered to be a safety of flight issue and
will not interfere with in−flight refueling operations. There are no NATOPs restrictions for this
loading/gain set ″mismatch″ condition. The degradation, if any, may become apparent for CGs aft of
approximately 30% MAC. Flaps AUTO lateral/directional and all flaps HALF or FULL flying
qualities are unaffected by this issue.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-6 ORIGINAL
The H2E−MC OFPs have incorporated an FCCGN advisory that is annunciated when the 5-Wet
loading information is declared invalid. The advisory is designed to notify the pilot that 5-Wet FCC
control law gains are no longer being applied. The consequence of the gains changing while still in the
5-Wet loading is identical to the H1E software build discussion above. That is, there may be some
longitudinal looseness while in AUTO flaps, but this will only be noticeable for aft CGs. Within the
NATOPS approved 5-Wet loading airspeed envelope (430 KCAS/0.8M), the degradation in flying
qualities stemming from the mismatched gain set is not considered to be a safety of flight issue.
11.1.6 Dual Midboard with Outboard Stores Handling Qualities.
NOTE
Loadings with dual carriage stores on stations 3 or 9 and an adjacent
store on stations 2 or 10 may experience uncommanded pitch
transients of ±1/2g to ±1g, roll transients of up to 20°/second, and/or
slight PIO at Mach 0.88−0.95 and less than 4° AOA. Roll-offs are more
likely during negative-g maneuvers. Transient severity may worsen at
lower altitude. Transients may increase pilot workload.
11.2 AIR COMBAT MANEUVERING.
11.2.1 Air-to-Air Gun Tracking. The flight characteristics described above combine to provide a very
agile fighter throughout the flight envelope. Excellent pitch pointing capabilities and lift vector
placement allow rapid acquisition and excellent fine tracking of air-to-air targets with little fear of
departure from controlled flight, especially at high AOA. However, the high airspeed bleed rate
associated with continued maneuvering at high AOA requires additional pilot attention to energy
management. Also, the presence of airframe buffet at elevated-g and high subsonic Mach numbers may
induce small pitch and roll transients and require increased workload to maintain precise pipper
placement.
11.2.2 Over-the-Top Maneuvering. The aircraft exhibits excellent slow speed over-the-top maneuverability. Aft stick is required near the top of looping maneuvers to keep the nose tracking until the
nose is below the horizon and airspeed is increasing. If aft stick is not maintained, AOA feedback
results in nose-down stabilator which eventually reduces AOA below 22°. Once below 22° AOA, neutral
longitudinal stick results in an inverted, nose-high attitude with only a small amount of pitch rate as
the FCS attempts to maintain 1g. If airspeed is allowed to decay in this attitude, or is insufficient to
complete the maneuver, a tailslide may result (see Departure Characteristics).
11.2.3 Slow Speed Maneuvering. The excellent controllability and maneuverability at high AOA
provided by FCS control laws result in very precise nose pointing and gun tracking at extremely low
airspeeds. When large and abrupt heading reversals are required during offensive or defensive
maneuvering at high AOA and low airspeed, two features discussed earlier allow the pilot to accelerate
aircraft motion without compromising departure resistance. The first is the enhanced nose-down pitch
rate capability below 200 KCAS which allows very rapid nose-down pitch pointing to acquire the target
at the end of a flat scissors engagement or to rapidly reduce AOA to maximize energy addition. The
second is the ″pirouette″ turning capability at high AOA and low airspeed which allows very rapid and
controllable nose-high to nose-low heading reversals. These two features combine to significantly
enhance maneuverability at high AOA, allowing the pilot to quickly bring the nose to bear on air-to-air
opponents.

IV-11-7 ORIGINAL
11.3 OUT-OF-CONTROL FLIGHT (OCF)
11.3.1 Departure Resistance. A departure is defined by aircraft motion that is contrary to flight
control inputs. Flight test has shown the F/A-18E/F is very resistant to departure from controlled
flight with symmetric loadings. No departure tendencies were found for single-axis control inputs and
for the majority of multi-axis inputs. A few departure tendencies exist with multi-axis inputs, but these
were usually found to occur beyond the 360° bank angle change limitation (two exceptions are
described in 11.3.2.1). Nose high, slow speed maneuvers that result in insufficient maneuvering
airspeed or a tailslide will cause a departure. Overall, the aircraft is very departure resistant when flown
within NATOPS limits. Additionally, clean and multiple store loadings (including aft CG), have shown
no self-sustaining falling leaf mode in the F/A-18E/F. For all known departure modes, following
NATOPS out-of-control (OCF) recovery procedures result in rapid recovery.
11.3.2 Departure Characteristics. The typical F/A-18E/F departure occurs as a yaw divergence
(nose-slice) followed by an uncommanded roll in the same direction. Usually, a departure is preceded
by a buildup in sideforce. This sideforce is often accompanied by ″vortex rumble″ generated from
excessive sideslip. ″Vortex rumble″ may not be noticeable during aggressive maneuvering; therefore,
excessive sideforce provides the most reliable departure warning cue. The initial phase of the departure
is not particularly violent or disorienting unless it occurs at high airspeed or Mach number. The yaw
rate warning tone may not provide sufficient departure warning. Post-departure gyrations self-recover
with controls released. Application of controls during post-departure gyrations may delay recovery.
11.3.2.1 Maneuvering within NATOPS Limits. There are three typical departure cases found for
flight within NATOPS limits.
1. Forward corner inputs below 300 KCAS.
Lateral stick and/or pedal combined with forward inputs at low airspeed may cause a departure prior
to reaching 360° bank angle change limit if AOA transitions from positive to zero or negative during
the roll. The departure is characterized by a dwell at 0 g, followed by a sideslip build-up and
subsequent moderate yaw rate spike (40 to 50 °/sec) and AOA increase. Subtle differences in roll rate
and nose-down pitch rates being generated by such inputs make it difficult to predict whether a
departure or favorable (faster than normal) roll rates will occur.
Lateral stick and/or pedal combined with forward inputs at low airspeed
may cause a departure.
2. Lateral stick with pedal and forward stick at high altitude and supersonic speeds.
This input is predicted to cause a departure that could result in aircraft damage. This departure is
possible at supersonic airspeed above 40,000 ft MSL and within 360° of bank angle change.
3. Tailslides and over-the-top maneuvering with insufficient airspeed.
NATOPS prohibits zero airspeed tailslides and intentional departures or spins. The obvious
consequence of over-the-top maneuvering with insufficient airspeed is departure from controlled
flight. In general, tailslides that are purely vertical induce departures that are benign and quick to
recover. Tailslides with large yaw angle (nose vertical but 3 to 9 line off the horizon) or over-the-top
maneuvering with sizable bank angle and insufficient airspeed usually result in a ″sideslide″ type
motion. The resulting sideslide departure motion is similar to vertical but typically is accompanied
by an abrupt roll snap before the aircraft settles nose low. If the sideslide motion yields excessive
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-8 ORIGINAL
gravity-induced sideslip at relatively slow airspeed (<90 KCAS), the resulting yawing motion from
the growing aerodynamic forces can quickly develop into a spin. If the aircraft falls inverted, then the
AOA will simultaneously build negative and may result in an inverted spin. Inverted spins from
sideslides are slower to recover than upright sideslide recoveries.
11.3.2.2 Maneuvering Outside of NATOPS Limits.
NOTE
The following describe the known departure characteristics of the
aircraft if flown outside of the NATOPS limits.
11.3.2.2.1 Exceeding 360° Roll Limit. Certain airspeed and control input combinations held for
greater than the NATOPS bank angle change limit of 360° can lead to departures. Lateral stick with
pedal and forward stick from high g near 300 KCAS may result in a severe departure, with yaw rates
reaching above 100°/sec a possibility. Another severe departure is possible when slowly pulling aft stick
(less than 1 inch/sec) while rolling with a full lateral stick input below 210 KCAS, if initiated near 1g.
This departure can generate yaw rates briefly in excess of 120°/sec and negative g spikes from -2 to -3
g. Each of these departures was found only to occur when controls were held beyond the 360° bank
angle change limit.
11.3.2.2.2 Exceeding Asymmetric Loading AOA Limits. Exceeding NATOPS limits for asymmetric
store loadings can also lead to departures. Aggressive longitudinal maneuvers that result in AOA
beyond NATOPS limits can lead to a benign departure that begins as a slow roll toward the heavy wing
and yaw away from the heavy wing that cannot be controlled with lateral stick or rudder pedal.
Recovery is immediate as soon as AOA is reduced to within limits. Large sideslips create a greater risk
of a more violent departure. At higher speeds, aggressive maneuvering at elevated-g above AOA limits
can result in sudden departures with little or no warning. If limits are exceeded and a departure does
occur, post departure gyrations rapidly transition to an upright spin away from the heavy wing.
Recovery from this type of departure has been demonstrated with up to a 24,000 ft-lb lateral weight
asymmetry following NATOPS OCF recovery procedures (see Spin Characteristics).
11.3.2.3 Maneuvering with Flight Control System Failures. Continued maneuvering with flight
control system failures such as surfaces failed off (X’s in all channels of that actuator), air data, or other
sensor failures can also lead to departure. The flight control system is designed to provide adequate
flying qualities with actuator and other FCS failures as long as AOA and load factor are maintained
within NATOPS limits. In the event of FCS failures, reducing AOA and load factor to wings level 1g
flight as soon as possible minimizes the possibility of a departure. If a departure does occur, following
OCF procedures results in the most rapid recovery.
11.3.3 Spin Characteristics. Entry into a spin is rare for symmetrically loaded F/A-18E/F. On a few
occasions, moderate yaw rate spins have developed from departures experiencing large gravity-induced
sideslip excursions (e.g. sideslips or nose-high slow airspeed flight while banked near 90°). If AOA is
simultaneously negative, the spin will be inverted.
For high lateral weight asymmetry loadings, the aircraft is extremely departure resistant within
NATOPS AOA limits. Exceeding AOA limits for high lateral weight asymmetries will most likely result
in an upright spin away from the heavy wing. Spin recoveries for less common upright spins into the
heavy wing, and inverted spins, can be delayed due to the oscillatory nature of the spin. Spin recovery
has been extensively proven for lateral asymmetries up to 14,000 ft-lb for both spins into and away
from the heavy wing with positive recoveries demonstrated in all cases.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-9 ORIGINAL
Spin characteristics and recovery with asymmetries greater than 14,000 ft-lb have not been fully
tested. A departure with 24,000 ft-lb of asymmetry resulted in a high yaw rate spin (greater than
100°/sec) within 3 to 5 seconds. Recovery occurred within two to three turns and about 10,000 feet of
altitude loss after applying NATOPS OCF recovery procedures. High yaw rate spins typically result in
longitudinal accelerations at the pilot seat as high as -3.5g (eyeballs out). Consequently, accomplishing
spin recovery procedures can be difficult with an unlocked seat harness.
Spin recovery is straightforward and reliable if the OCF procedures are followed and sufficient
altitude remains. If a spin is encountered (Spin recovery display on the DDI), recovery occurs very
shortly after initiating NATOPS OCF recovery procedures, particularly from inverted spins. Recovery
from spins with high lateral weight asymmetry may require an additional turn or two.
Selection of manual spin recovery mode (SPIN switch in RCVY) seriously degrades controllability, prevents recovery from any departure or
spin, and is prohibited.
NOTE
During highly oscillatory spins or spins that transform from upright to
inverted or from inverted to upright, the spin recovery display may
disappear momentarily.
11.4 DEGRADED MODE HANDLING QUALITIES.
The reliability of the FCS is very high and when failures do occur, usually occur singly. No single
electrical failure affects flying qualities and multiple FCS failures are required to degrade flying
qualities. Depending on which combination of failures has occurred, flying qualities may be considerably degraded. Degraded flying qualities associated with some of the more serious or more common
FCS failures are described here. Appropriate corrective action is presented in the Warning/Caution/
Advisory Displays, figure 12-1.
11.4.1 Single Engine Operation.
11.4.1.1 Flaps AUTO. Engine failure or shutdown with flaps AUTO results in no degradation in
handling qualities under most circumstances at low AOA. A small amount of yaw trim may be required
to counter asymmetric thrust effects. At high AOA, engine failure results in a yaw toward the failed
engine that is controllable by quickly reducing AOA and countering the yaw with rudder. During hard
maneuvering, a slight degradation in handling qualities may be noticeable at less than Mach 1.0
between approximately 400 to 500 KCAS where the hydraulic system normally operates at 5,000 psi.
At these conditions 5,000 psi operation is inhibited by the FCS to maintain a windmill air-start
capability. When 5,000 psi operation is inhibited, flying qualities may be degraded during aggressive
maneuvers since there may not be enough hydraulic power to fully deflect numerous flight control
surfaces. A reduction in departure resistance can also be expected anytime normal 5,000 psi hydraulic
system operation is inhibited.
11.4.1.2 Flaps HALF or FULL. Single engine minimum control speed (Vmc) is defined as the
minimum airspeed required to maintain controlled flight with one engine operating. Vmc airspeeds
were determined at 14° AOA for catapult launches, and 12° AOA for all other circumstances. Vmc
airspeed varies depending on AOA, lateral asymmetry, altitude, and day temperature. For an engine
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-10 ORIGINAL
failure off the catapult, 14° AOA provides the best compromise between arresting rate of descent off
the bow and controllability (increased AOA helps arrest sink but also reduces lateral-directional
controllability). In all cases, once control is established (and sink is stopped), allow the aircraft to
accelerate to on-speed to provide the best flyaway handling qualities. When an engine fails in flaps
HALF or FULL, the first perceptible aircraft motion is a yaw toward the failed engine. The rudders are
the primary flight control surface used to counter the yaw caused by the operating engine. Using too
much rudder pedal is not harmful, but using too little rudder pedal may not counter the yaw and cause
controllability problems. In addition to yawing into the failed engine, the aircraft also tends to roll into
the failed engine. The natural pilot reaction is to oppose the roll with lateral stick, but the resulting
differential aileron deflection generates adverse yaw and increases the demand on the rudders to
maintain directional control. As AOA increases above 10° AOA, the aircraft becomes less directionally
stable and rudder control effectiveness deteriorates. In this instance, the rudders may become
saturated (surfaces against the stops). When saturated, the rudders cannot counter any additional
adverse yaw, resulting in an increase in sideslip and the potential for an adverse yaw departure. If
airspeed is too slow, the rudders cannot generate enough control power to oppose the yaw toward the
failed engine.
For some situations, controllability alone will not guarantee flyaway (e.g., excessive rate of descent),
but may only ensure controllability for a long enough period of time to complete the requisite
immediate action procedures and make a timely ejection decision, if warranted.
When single engine with the operating engine at MAX, the possibility of
an adverse yaw departure increases as AOA exceeds on-speed.
NOTE
• In straight and level flight, a small amount of lateral and/or directional
trim is required to maintain balanced flight.
• Loss of either HYD 1 or HYD 2 due to engine failure or hydraulic
pump failure does not effect flight control with flaps AUTO; however,
failure of either HYD 1 or HYD 2 with flaps in HALF or FULL may
cause uncommanded but controllable yaw and roll transients as the
switching valves cycle. These yaw and roll transients may last 3 to 6
seconds.
• To prevent repeated switching valve cycling, avoid stabilized flight
where engine windmill rpm results in hydraulic pressure fluctuations
between 800 and 2,000 psi.
11.4.1.3 Single Engine Waveoff. Refer to Chapter 16, paragraphs 16.1 and 16.3.
11.4.2 Leading Edge Flap Asymmetry. Leading edge flap asymmetries can occur when one of the
LEF hydraulic drive units (HDU) stalls/fails or the mechanical interconnect between the inboard and
outboard LEF surfaces fails. The most common LEF asymmetry results from a weak LEF HDU that
stalls (stops moving due to aerodynamic loading) during abrupt longitudinal maneuvers at high
airspeed and low altitude. When this happens, a roll-off away from the failing HDU as AOA or g is
increased followed by an abrupt roll-off in the opposite direction is typical. Failure detection logic in
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-11 ORIGINAL
the FCS software is designed to provide advanced warning of a LEF asymmetry; however, during
extremely abrupt maneuvers, an HDU stall may not be detected in time to allow the pilot to abandon
the maneuver and avoid a large roll transient. The FCS software uses two specific monitors to detect
weak LEF HDUs. The first monitor results in a FLAP SCHED caution accompanied with BLIN 256.
It sets and holds the FLAP SCHED caution for 6 seconds following the HDU stall. The second monitor
results in a FLAP SCHED caution accompanied by a BLIN 537. When accompanied by a BLIN 537,
the FLAP SCHED caution is displayed only as long as the failing HDU condition exists (e.g., when
AOA >12°).
Avoid high-g maneuvers at low altitude if an HDU stall has been detected during the flight (BLIN
256 or 537 on the FCS status page) even if the FLAP SCHED caution has cleared. BLINs 256 and 537
indicate a weak/failing HDU that may result in very large roll transients and/or over-g during high-g
maneuvers.
11.4.2.1 LEF Failure Landing Handling Qualities (Symmetric or Asymmetric). With a LEF failure,
the LEF symmetric commands are frozen when the FLAP switch is set to AUTO; however, differential
LEF and TEF continue to be commanded. With the FLAP switch set to HALF or FULL, the LEF
commands are frozen while the TEF and aileron droop commands follow the normal schedules for PA.
Shore and ship based flight tests were conducted with LEF frozen at both symmetric and asymmetric
(up to 34°/5° LEF split) deflections. Straight in, on-speed approaches in flaps HALF are recommended
for all frozen symmetric or asymmetric LEF configurations. General flying qualities, as well as waveoff
and T&G performance are acceptable for all LEF configurations.
Light to moderate buffet is present in most of the LEF configurations, especially for AOA greater
than on-speed. The buffet is more pronounced with LEF deflections significantly less than the normal
scheduled positions. Selecting flaps FULL with small LEF deflections results in higher buffet levels at
lower AOAs than with the FLAP switch set to HALF. Noticeable buffet is normal near on-speed
conditions with either HALF or FULL flaps for the degraded LEF condition, but may be uncomfortable during maneuvering. Maintaining on-speed or slightly fast approach AOA (to minimize buffet)
results in the best flying qualities for any off-schedule symmetric or asymmetric (left/right) LEF
configuration. Where practical, flying slightly fast (6-7° AOA) minimizes exposure to the buffet. For
carrier landings, the tendency to fly the approach in a ″fast″ condition should be avoided because the
recovery WOD requirements are based on the on-speed approach airspeed. Flying a ″fast″ approach
may result in aircraft and/or arresting gear overstress upon arrestment.
Small (1-3°) roll-off due to buffet can be expected but is easily controllable with small lateral inputs.
Roll and line up control are not significantly different than normal scheduled positions. The aircraft
rolls faster into the lesser-deflected LEF and slower when rolling away from the lesser-deflected LEF.
Roll-off may also be experienced with AOA/pitch attitude changes. As AOA decreases, the aircraft rolls
away from the lesser-deflected LEF and as AOA increases, the aircraft rolls into the lesser-deflected
LEF. Lateral stick and/or trim easily counters this roll-off tendency. A small roll off will occur with
airspeed changes during a waveoff or bolter but are easily controlled with small lateral stick inputs.
Glideslope control degradations are more pronounced with LEF deflections significantly less than
the normal scheduled positions. The addition of wing stores will further degrade glideslope control.
The aircraft response to power corrections is sluggish and smaller in magnitude than normal flap
configurations. Therefore, compared to normal flap configurations, larger, longer and more anticipatory power corrections are required to effect a glideslope change. Power corrections translate to an
airspeed change first before a rate of descent change is noticed. The delay in aircraft response coupled
with the larger throttle inputs leads to the tendency to over−control the glideslope. The technique of
applying power and waiting for a glideslope change will lead to larger glideslope deviations.

Anticipatory throttle inputs are key to controlling glideslope. The sluggish power response also
degrades waveoff performance slightly. When operating shipboard, the waveoff window for all LEF
failure conditions should be moved farther out and the LSOs should be made aware of the degraded
glideslope performance. Upon bolter/waveoff, climb−out attitude will appear flatter than normal. The
LSOs and PRIFLY personnel should monitor rate of climb as the primary indication of bolter/waveoff
performance. It is recommended aircrew perform a familiarization check of aircraft response to control
and throttle inputs, including a waveoff maneuver, prior to attempting a shipboard landing.
11.4.3 Trailing Edge Flap Failure. TEF failures may be caused by an actuator failure (mechanical or
three-four channel failure) or by a dual HYD 1A/2B circuit failure. TEF actuators continue to operate
following two channel failures. If a TEF actuator is shutdown, the surface is hydraulically or
aerodynamically driven to 5° TED and locked. If the left to right TEF asymmetry exceeds 6°, the
opposite TEF fails off and is also driven to 5° TED and locked.
11.4.3.1 TEF Failure Landing Handling Qualities. Shore and ship based flight tests have been
conducted with the TEF in the failed position of 5° TED. Straight in, 10° AOA approaches in flaps
HALF or FULL are recommended for TEF failures. Pitch, roll, and line up control are similar to those
for normal approaches. Approach speeds will be high and every attempt should be made to reduce gross
weight. If shore based, consideration should be given to making an arrested landing taking into account
maximum arresting gear engagement speed and nose tire limit.
With this failure, approach drag is reduced and approach power settings are less than normal. This
results in slower engine response to throttle changes compared to normal HALF or FULL flap
approaches. Flying a slightly slow approach (10° AOA) reduces approach speed and increases approach
power setting slightly. Flying qualities at 10° AOA are similar or improved over those observed at
on-speed AOA. The aircraft easily trims to and maintains 10°AOA. Glideslope maintenance will
dominate the approach task and the tendency is to relax AOA maintenance. The 10° AOA approach
reduces WOD requirements by approximately 12 to 16 KCAS and improves approach flying qualities.
When operating at the ship, the recovery WOD should be kept as close as possible to the Aircraft
Recovery Bulletin recommendations. Due to the large difference between WOD requirements at
on−speed and 10° AOA, it is imperative that AOA be maintained at 10°. The sight picture behind the
ship is altered, but the field of view over the nose is not degraded.
Slower engine response to throttle changes may result in excessive sink
rates under high WOD conditions. The recovery WOD should be kept as
close as possible to the Aircraft Recovery Bulletin recommendations.
The aircraft response to power corrections is sluggish and smaller in magnitude than for normal TEF
configurations. TEF failures require larger, longer, and more anticipatory power corrections to effect
a glideslope change. There is a tendency to over control the power due to the low approach power
setting and the longer time to effect a change. Power corrections translate to an airspeed change first
before a rate of descent change is noticed. Aggressive, well−timed, and anticipatory throttle inputs are
required for glideslope control. The technique of applying power and waiting for a glideslope change
will lead to larger glideslope deviations. Waveoff performance is degraded for TEF failure approaches.
The waveoff technique is the same as normal flap configurations; apply power, maintain AOA until
positive rate of climb is achieved, and capture 10° pitch attitude for the climb−out. Time to achieve
positive rate of climb is slower than for normal TEF configurations. At the ship, the waveoff window
for a TEF failure condition should be moved farther out. The LSOs should be aware of degraded

waveoff and glideslope performance. Upon bolter/waveoff, climb−out attitude will appear flatter than
normal. The LSOs and PRIFLY personnel should monitor rate of climb as the primary indication of
bolter/waveoff performance. It is recommended aircrew perform a familiarization check of aircraft
response to control and throttle inputs, including a waveoff maneuver, prior to attempting a shipboard
landing.
11.4.4 Stabilator Failure. Since there is no mechanical reversion mode of the flight controls, the FCS
control laws automatically reconfigure in each axis to allow continued flight in the event of a single
stabilator failure. This failure mode, known as stabilator reconfiguration, or STAB RECON, is
designed to compensate for the loss of the contribution of the failed stabilator to pitch and roll control.
This is accomplished by disabling differential stabilator commands and using the other rolling surfaces
to counter the roll and yaw moments produced when the remaining stabilator responds to pitch axis
commands. Flight tests demonstrated excellent handling qualities with a stabilator failed off during
maneuvering flight and aerial refueling. The pitch axis is slightly sluggish, maximum roll rate is
noticeably lower, and roll coordination is slightly degraded.
In UA, with a failed stabilator, maximum roll rate is extremely low in the
transonic region below 20,000 feet, especially when rolling away from the
failed side. Significant roll and yaw coupling may occur with forward stick
inputs at Mach >1.4 and altitude >30,000 feet.
The degradation in roll coordination is characterized as a small amount of sideforce during lateral
inputs with flaps AUTO and noticeable sideslip with flaps HALF. Configuration changes exhibit a
slight roll toward the failed stabilator when transitioning from flaps AUTO to flaps HALF; away from
the failed stabilator when transitioning from flaps HALF to flaps AUTO. Flight tests demonstrated
that flight with a stabilator failed in flaps HALF was nearly transparent to the pilot from a handling
qualities perspective during normal approaches, waveoffs, and bolters or flared landings. A small but
controllable yaw away from the failed stabilator is apparent at touchdown. Additionally, pitch stick
inputs during the landing roll complicate directional control and should be avoided.
Extending the speedbrake may produce uncommanded roll into the failed stabilator. The uncommanded roll is more pronounced at low speed flight conditions due to the reduced aileron effectiveness
at the large trailing edge up aileron deflections commanded by the speedbrake function. The roll can
be balanced with lateral stick deflection.
In UA, with a failed stabilator, nose down pitching moment capability is degraded at low to moderate
airspeeds, especially for aft center of gravity and heavy wing store loadings. A safe level of nose down
pitch capability is available for flight below 10° angle of attack.
In UA, with a failed stabilator, do not exceed 10° AOA due to reduced
nose down pitch authority.
Carrier based flight tests (STAB RECON/flaps HALF) demonstrated that carrier approaches were
easily controlled but were characterized by slightly degraded flying qualities which required increased
pilot attention to the landing task. Slight rolling and/or yawing motions were apparent when making
longitudinal inputs. Multiple small lateral inputs were required to maintain a centered approach.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-14 ORIGINAL
During bolters, the aircraft yawed into the good stabilator when the flight control system deflected the
good stabilator trailing edge up (TEU) in preparation for aircraft nose down rotation. The yaw was
sudden and pronounced, but easily controlled with rudder to counter the yawing motion.
Flight with flaps FULL has not been demonstrated due to limited nose-up control authority from
the remaining good stabilator.
• Do not select flaps FULL for landing with a failed stabilator, because
longitudinal control authority may be insufficient for landing.
• With a failed stabilator, do not exceed 10° AOA in AUTO flaps with
wing stores or wing tanks.
11.4.5 GAIN ORIDE. While not a failure mode, GAIN ORIDE is prescribed for certain AOA or
pitot-static sensor failures to provide better or more predictable handling qualities (see Warning/
Caution/Advisory Displays, figure 12-1). With flaps AUTO, selecting GAIN ORIDE results in fixed
gains that correspond to Mach 0.80, 39,000 feet, and 250 KCAS. At flight conditions that deviate from
the fixed gains, a slight degradation in handling qualities should be expected. The aircraft is less
sensitive to longitudinal inputs, as less pitch rate is generated per given stick input. Lateral stick inputs
provide similar responses as in GAIN NORM. In GAIN ORIDE, the aircraft is more sensitive to
directional inputs. Regardless, handling qualities remain very good within the 10° AOA and 350 KCAS
NATOPS limits for GAIN ORIDE operation. If the airspeed limit is exceeded, self-sustained pitch
oscillations will start to occur above 375 KCAS, and the aircraft will become uncontrollable above 450
KCAS due to the fixed air data values in the flight control system gains. If the AOA limit is exceeded,
departures are likely since the fixed values of the air data and AOA severely reduce departure
resistance. Additionally, the aircraft will stall at a higher than normal airspeed due to the fixed position
of the LEFs.
With flaps HALF or FULL, GAIN ORIDE results in fixed gains that correspond to 8.1° AOA and
500 feet; handling qualities are best at these conditions and degrade slightly away from on-speed AOA.
At higher airspeeds in 1g flight, the aircraft will stabilize at lower than normal AOA, due to the TEF
position frozen at higher than normal deflections. While not dangerous, this characteristic is
uncomfortable. Also, at higher airspeeds, higher than normal aft stick force is required to maintain
flight path while in a turn. Flight is prohibited above 190 KCAS (flaps FULL) or 200 KCAS (flaps
HALF) due to these characteristics. Flight is also prohibited above 10° AOA due to the reduced stall
margin available with fixed LEF deflections.
Transition to or from landing configuration should be done in level flight at 180 KCAS. Transition
should not be made while in a bank due to the higher than normal aft stick forces required to maintain
flight path angle. Sideslip excursions may also occur if flap transition is made in a turn.
Carrier based flight tests (GAIN ORIDE/flaps HALF) demonstrated satisfactory approach handling
qualities. The aircraft remained easily controllable, though increased pilot attention to the landing task
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-15 ORIGINAL
was required. During descent, small longitudinal inputs were required to maintain proper AOA and
pitch attitude. Approaches flown at conditions other than on-speed resulted in sluggish longitudinal
handling qualities.
Bolters in GAIN ORIDE or with AOA failed require positive aft stick
during rotation, 1/2 aft stick is recommended. Deflections of less than 1/2
aft stick will result in excess settle during bolters.
In GAIN ORIDE, AOA will tend to readily increase above 14° when
decelerating from a trimmed on-speed condition. Timely longitudinal
stick inputs will be required to prevent excessive sink rates and correct a
deceleration as power alone will not change the AOA or pitch attitude
sufficiently in GAIN ORIDE. Alpha tone is disabled in GAIN ORIDE
with FLAPS HALF or FULL.
11.4.6 AHRS Failure Flying Qualities. An AHRS channel failure is defined as the loss of both rate
and acceleration data (Xs in CAS P, CAS R, CAS Y, N ACC, and L ACC). Single or dual channel AHRS
failures should have no adverse effect on flying qualities. If a third channel failure is detected, all four
channels will be Xd out because the FCCs will be unable to confirm which channel is providing valid
data. If the third failure can be isolated to a particular channel, all four channels will be Xd out but
the flying qualities will be unaffected with the exception of a small degradation to the g-limiter. If a
third failure occurs but is not detected (two columns of Xs), or is detected but not isolated to a
particular channel (four columns of Xs), flying qualities will be somewhat degraded. When flying
qualities are degraded due to AHRS channel failures, poor roll coordination for large lateral inputs,
pitch coupling, and/or sluggish pitch response can be expected. Due to the higher reliability of AHRS
over previous rate and acceleration sensors, a four channel failure is highly unlikely. However,
simulator evaluation has shown that a complete four channel AHRS failure (no rate and acceleration
inputs to FCCs) is controllable for most of the flight envelope with the flaps in AUTO. Refer to figure
11-1 for AHRS channel failure indications and effects.
AHRS failure modes have not been flight tested. With a four channel
AHRS failure, the aircraft is not controllable with the flaps in HALF or
FULL. At altitudes above 25,000 feet, loss of control occurs below Mach
0.92. For loss of AHRS above 25,000 feet, maintain airspeed above Mach
0.92 while descending.
With a four channel AHRS failure at altitudes below 20,000 feet, flying qualities are optimum
between 190 to 210 KCAS, and are acceptable above 370 KCAS. When decelerating below 370 KCAS,
flying qualities are degraded until below 270 KCAS. The worst flying qualities are between 270 to 370
KCAS. Flying qualities do improve above 370 KCAS, with a further improvement at supersonic speeds.
Execute a straight-in on-speed approach with flaps in AUTO, and limit angle of bank to 20°. Pitch and
directional damping will be very low and roll coordination weak. If not positioned for landing by in the
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IV-11-16 ORIGINAL
middle to in close, a wave-off and go-around should be executed. A clean, lightly loaded aircraft
exhibits the best flying qualities. Flying qualities are not affected by CG locations, and the aircraft can
be landed to the aft CG limit. An arrested landing should be made if airspeed permits. Avoid stabilator
braking.

CHAPTER 12
General Emergencies
12.1 GENERAL
Part V contains procedures to correct an abnormal or emergency condition. While these procedures
provide guidance in dealing with an emergency; they should be modified, as required, in case of
multiple/combined emergencies, adverse weather, or other peculiar factors. Use common sense and
sound judgment to determine the correct course of action.
Unless specifically stated in NATOPS, BLIN or MSP codes shall not be used for in-flight decision
making.
Apply the following rules to all emergencies:
1. Aviate: first and foremost, maintain aircraft control.
2. Analyze the situation and take proper action. Perform immediate action procedures without
delay; however, initially do only those steps required to manage the problem. When operating a
control, be prepared to immediately return the control to its former setting if an undesirable
response occurs.
3. Navigate: land as soon as practical, unless the situation dictates otherwise.
4. Communicate: As soon as possible, notify the flight lead, ship, ATC (air traffic control), or tower
of the emergency, aircraft position, and intended course of action. Relay emergency indications,
actions taken, flight conditions, power setting, etc., as time permits.
12.1.1 Immediate Action Items. Procedural steps preceded by an asterisk (*) are considered
immediate action items. Pilots shall be able to accomplish these steps without reference to the Pocket
Checklist (PCL).
12.1.2 Warnings, Cautions, and Advisories. Warnings, cautions, and advisories are displayed in the
cockpit on the LDDI, on the upper warning/caution/advisory lights panels, or on the lower right
caution lights panel. Certain cautions provide two indications: one on the LDDI and one on the lower
right caution lights panel.
Warnings, cautions, and advisories are categorized and are listed alphabetically by category in figure
12-1 together with cause, remarks, and corrective action. Potential cause(s) for the associated
warning/caution/advisory is indicated by a bullet (•) under the Cause/Remarks column. The categories
are as follows:
a. Warning Lights.
b. DDI Cautions and Caution Lights not associated with FCES or HYD cautions.
c. Flight Control Electronic System (FCES) Cautions.
d. Hydraulic System (HYD) Cautions.
e. DDI Advisories.
f. Advisory Lights.
g. CFIT Voice Warnings.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-12-1 ORIGINAL
DDI cautions and advisories are listed in CAPS. Warning, caution, and advisory lights are
distinguished by a box around the legend (e.g., ).
Where appropriate, voice aural warnings are listed in quotation marks with their respective warning
or caution. If a DDI caution or caution light starts with a single letter (for example L, R, P, or Y) that
letter is not used to place the caution alphabetically.

Warning Light
‘‘APU Fire,
APU Fire’’
• Fire/overheat condition detected in the APU bay.
APU FIRE extinguishing system operates automatically
with WonW and must be manually activated with WoffW.
System activation secures fuel to the APU, arms the fire
bottle, and discharges the bottle after a 10 second delay.
Discharge is delayed to allow the APU time to spool down
before extinguishing agent is introduced.
• Since the fire extinguishing system requires 28 vdc
essential bus power, the fire bottle may not be discharged
if the BATT switch is turned OFF during the 10 second
delay time.
• Airborne, if the DISCH light does not come on 10
seconds after the APU FIRE and READY/DISCH lights
have been pushed, the READY/DISCH light should be
pushed and held until the DISCH light comes on.
IN FLIGHT or on GROUND

FIRE
Warning Light
″Engine Fire Left
(Right),
Engine Fire Left
(Right)″
• Fire/overheat condition detected in corresponding
engine/AMAD bay.
If dual FIRE light indications and unable to determine which
light came on first, check engine instruments for indications of
a fire. High fuel flow, high EGT, rough running, or smoke and
fumes may indicate the affected side, even if present prior to
the FIRE light coming on. Do not hesitate to push the FIRE
EXTGH READY light and lower the HOOK handle once
FIRE procedures have been initiated. If the hook release cable
is damaged by an engine bay fire, it may be impossible to
lower the hook.
• The probability of extinguishing a fire and preventing
relights is greatly increased by immediately discharging the
fire extinguisher.
• An engine bay fire may damage the engine bay door, which
is critical to structural integrity. Following an engine bay
fire, limit maneuvering to 5g, limit descent rate at
touchdown to less than 1,000 fpm, and minimize roll and
yaw at landing. An off-center arrestment following an engine
fire can lead to catastrophic structural failure.

INDICATOR • CAUSE / REMARKS CORRECTIVE ACTION
HOOK
(Red)
Warning Light
• Arresting hook position does not agree with HOOK handle
position.
• Hook not fully extended with the HOOK handle down in
flight.
• Hook down with WonW.
With the HOOK light on, the HOOK handle up, and the
hook up, the hook will drop during engine shutdown.
Ensure personnel are clear of the hook prior to engine
shutdown
If the mechanical hook uplatch mechanism fails, the hook
cannot be released and an arrested landing is not possible. If
the hook is unlocked (HOOK handle down) but fails to leave
the up position, an arresting hook system failure may be
applying HYD 2B pressure to hold the hook up. For this
reason, pulling the HOOK circuit breaker deenergizes the
hook selector valve and ensures HYD 2B pressure is removed.
If the arresting hook snubber is not properly charged, the
arresting hook may not fully extend due to airloads and HYD
2B back-pressure. In this case, if reducing airspeed does not
extinguish the HOOK light, shutting down the right engine
reduces HYD 2B back-pressure and should increase arresting
hook extension. After engine restart, the hook may retract at a
maximum rate of 2° minute. If the HOOK light remains on
after this procedure and a visual inspection confirms the hook
is partially extended, a successful arrestment is possible due to
g-loads at landing.
IN FLIGHT
1. Reduce airspeed.
If HOOK light remains on -
2. Get a visual inspection (if practical).
If the hook is in the up position -
2. HOOK circuit breaker - PULL
If the HOOK light remains on and
the hook is partially extended -
3. Throttle right engine - IDLE for one
minute then OFF
4. Reduce airspeed to drop HYD2
pressure to zero (if practical).
5. Restart for landing.
If hook still fails to extend (Carrier
landing) -
6. Divert.
If the hook is partially extended -
7. Attempt a normal carrier landing.

L BAR
Warning Light
ON DECK
• Launch bar control system malfunction (proximity switch
failure).
IN FLIGHT
• Launch bar failed to retract after catapult launch (Launch
bar not up and locked AND weight off the left main gear).
• Launch bar control system malfunction (proximity switch
failure).
If the red L BAR light remains on, assume that the launch bar
is NOT up and locked and it may drop to the deck during
landing. The nose landing gear cannot be retracted. Placing
the LDG GEAR handle UP raises the main landing gear and
leaves the nose landing gear extended.
ON DECK
1. Suspend catapult launch.
2. LAUNCH BAR switch - RETRACT
If launch bar fails to retract -
3. LB circuit breaker - PULL
IN FLIGHT
1. LDG GEAR handle - LEAVE DN (if
practical)
2. LAUNCH BAR switch - VERIFY
RETRACT
3. LB circuit breaker - PULL

normal landing. Refer to Landing
Gear Malfunction Landing Guide.
RALT Warning
(on UFCD)
• Aircraft is below the primary low altitude warning (LAW)
setting.
1. Climb above primary RALT setting or
reset LAW setting to a lower altitude.
SPN
Warning Light
• SPIN switch in the RCVY position.
Selection of manual spin recovery mode (SPIN switch to
RCVY) seriously degrades controllability, prevents recovery
from any departure or spin, and is prohibited.
1. SPIN switch - NORM (GUARD

AIR DATA
• MC unable to determine which source error
correction to utilize (e.g., configuration discrepancy).
• FCC source error correction disagrees with MC
commanded source error correction.
Caution is only activated WonW.
1. Perform FCS IBIT.
If caution remains/returns -
2. Do not takeoff.
L AMAD PR
R AMAD PR
• Loss of designated AMAD oil pressure.
Securing the GEN (ac output) greatly reduces the heat
load imparted to the AMAD oil and may prevent
heat-related damage to the generator.
A L/R AMAD PR caution could be an indication of an
AMAD oil leak which may result in an engine /AMAD
bay fire.
SINGLE GEN FAILURE AND AMAD PR
• A single GEN failure accompanied by an AMAD PR
caution on the same side is a potential indication of
major mechanical damage to the generator and
AMAD.
1. GEN switch affected engine - OFF
If more than 5 minutes to landing -
2. Throttle affected engine - OFF
3. Restart for landing (if required).
4. Land as soon as practical.
If restarting affected engine for landing -
5. GEN switch affected engine - ON
6. Affected engine - Restart
After engine restarted -
7. GEN switch affected engine - OFF
SINGLE GEN FAILURE AND AMAD PR
1. GEN switch affected engine – OFF (DO NOT RESET)
2. Throttle affected engine - OFF immediately (if
practical)
3. Land as soon as practical.
4. Execute Single Engine Approach and Landing procedure.
L ANTI ICE
R ANTI ICE
• Engine anti-ice valves failed to close when
commanded by the FADEC.
Unregulated engine anti-ice airflow may damage the
inlet device and cause potential engine FOD.
1. Throttle affected engine - IDLE
If not in icing conditions -
2. ENG ANTI ICE switch - OFF
If caution is removed -
3. Resume normal engine operation.
If caution remains/returns -
4. Throttle affected engine - IDLE
5. Land as soon as practical.
ANTISKID
• Anti-skid system failed BIT.
Anti-skid protection not available for use with normal
braking.
• Use of brakes without anti-skid at high speed can
result in blown tires resulting in loss of directional
control. If practical, rollout speed should be slow as
possible before applying brake pedal pressure.
D Do not cycle the ANTI SKID switch in response to
an ANTISKID caution immediately prior to landing
for the following reasons:
a. The ANTISKID caution is removed for up to
13.5 seconds as the system performs IBIT even
though the anti-skid system may still be failed.
b. If the system is not failed, wheel motion at
touchdown or during landing rollout may cause a
false BIT failure and a dump of normal brake
pressure when brakes are applied.
D If the ANTI SKID switch is not placed to OFF with
an ANTISKID caution displayed, normal braking
capability may be lost completely.
GROUND
1. ANTI SKID switch - OFF
IN FLIGHT
If more than 30 seconds to landing -
1. ANTI SKID switch - CYCLE ONCE
If caution reappears or if less than 30 seconds
to landing -
2. ANTI SKID switch - OFF (DO NOT CYCLE.)
3. Consider Short Field arrestment.
4. If arresting gear not available or not desired, regulate brake pedal force to prevent wheel skid.

• AOA warning tone in flaps AUTO is unavailable due
to AOA failure or more than one invalid value used
to calculate the FLY lateral weight asymmetry.
If caution caused by AOA failure, the AOA limit will
still be displayed on the CHKLST page. Otherwise, the
FLY lateral weight asymmetry value and AOA limit
value will be removed from the CHKLST page.
If caution caused by AOA failure -
1. Execute AOA Four Channel Failure procedure.
Otherwise -
1. Manually calculate lateral weight asymmetry to
determine AOA limit.
APU ACCUM
APU ACC
Caution Light
• APU accumulator pressure low (below 2,450 psi).
The APU ACCUM caution can be expected after APU
start or after emergency gear/probe extension in flight.
With WonW, the APU accumulator recharges
automatically. With WoffW, the HYD ISOL switch may
need to be held for up to 20 seconds following

AV AIR HOT
• The avionics undercool sensor, located forward of the
avionics bays, has determined that avionics airflow
and temperature are deficient. The system assumes
that if flow and temperature downstream of the
avionics bays are deficient, effective avionics cooling
is not being provided.
In flight, in ECS AUTO mode with the throttles above
IDLE, if an AV AIR HOT caution is displayed, then
the ECS is most likely degraded. On deck, the avionics
cooling fans provide adequate avionics cooling up to an
ambient temperature of approximately 103°F, but
above that an AV AIR HOT caution can be expected.
Advancing one or both throttles above approximately
74% N2 rpm or selecting AUG PULL should remove
the caution within 3 minutes. If an AV AIR HOT
caution cannot be cleared, maintenance action is
required.
Selection of MAN with the ECS MODE switch is
prohibited. Selecting MAN while the aft cooling fan
shutoff valve is open may cause the fan to overspeed
resulting in a catastrophic fan failure potentially
leading to loss of OBOGS.

If the dump valve cannot be closed, fuel continues
to dump until Tanks 1 and 4 are empty. Selecting
WING INHIBIT diverts recirculation fuel from the
wings to the feed tanks. Stopping external transfer
may make this fuel available if the dump valve is
subsequently closed. When uncommanded fuel
dump ceases (Tanks 1 and 4 empty), the feed tanks
should contain between 4,200 and 4,900 lb,
depending on JLS cycling.
Delaying landing until the transfer tanks are empty

ECS ICING
• The ECS compressor/turbine is icing (e.g., an
ECS valve failure or malfunction in the warm air
system which normally prevents ECS icing
occurred).
• ECS controller failure with altitude below 30,000
feet (ECS DEGD, MSP 8A0 or 8A1).
• ECS icing sensor failure with altitude below
30,000 feet (MSP 8E1).
For a sensor or ECS controller failure, the caution
is inhibited above 30,000 feet, since insufficient
moisture is present to cause ECS icing.
The ECS system incorporates a bypass valve
designed to prevent ECS compressor/turbine failure
when icing occurs. Depending on the severity of the
failure which caused the icing condition, the
capacity of the bypass valve may be exceeded. If an
ECS ICING caution appears (without MSPs 8A0,
8A1, or 8E1), there is one of two outcomes: (1)
bypass, in which case the system needs to be
de-iced but the ECS continues to function or (2)
the ECS compressor/turbine fails and conditioned
ECS airflow is lost (loss of cabin pressurization and
AV AIR HOT caution).
The ECS ICING caution may or may not be
removed after selecting OFF/RAM.
Selection of MAN with the ECS MODE switch is
prohibited. Selecting MAN while the aft cooling fan
shutoff valve is open may cause the fan to
overspeed resulting in a catastrophic fan failure
potentially leading to loss of OBOGS.

EXT TANK
• External tanks are pressurized with WonW (EXT
TANKS switch(es) in ORIDE).
• External tanks over pressurized with WoffW.
External tank pressurization is terminated for
in-flight refueling (PROBE switch in EXTEND) and
for arrested landing (both HOOK and LDG GEAR
handles down).
NOTE
Carrier launch prohibited with less than 2,700 lbs
(1,700 lbs for ARS) and greater than 100 lbs in
external drop tank.
GROUND
1. EXT TANKS switch(es) - VERIFY NORM
If caution remains -
2. Do not catapult.
IN FLIGHT
1. EXT TANKS switch(es) - STOP (when external
transfer complete)
EXT XFER
• One or more external tanks failed/slow to transfer
when commanded.
The EXT XFER caution can be set, even if no
failures exist, if the external fuel tanks do not transfer
at the same rate. During normal external fuel transfer,
fuel quantity splits between external tanks may be as
much as 2,000 lbs. with the centerline tank usually
transferring slower than the wing tank(s). As long as
external fuel transfer keeps the internal fuel tanks full
(greater than 12,000 lbs), no corrective action is
required.
Icing may occur in the external fuel tank
pressurization system inhibiting external tank transfer
and refueling. Descending and accelerating may
reduce the effects of icing.
Failure to transfer may also affect ability to refuel
affected tank(s). If in-flight refueling is required,
consider inhibiting refueling of external tank(s) that
set the caution and were slow to transfer
(corresponding EXT TANKS switch to STOP).
When in 5-wet loading, if fuel is transferred from IB
tanks before MB tanks are empty, failure to maintain
airspeed below 300 KCAS/0.6 IMN, whichever is less,
may result in aircraft structural damage.
NOTE
In the event that an ARS Control Panel is installed in
the aircraft, the TRANS switch on the ARS Control
Panel overrides the FUEL panel.

• Tank 1 and 4 fuel is not scheduling properly (e.g., Tank
4 full and Tank 1 empty).
INTERAL WING TANK FAILURE
• Most likely result of a valve failure.
• If one internal wing tank fails to transfer, the other is
commanded to stop transferring when wing tank balance
logic detects a 200 lb split.
• When Tank 4 drops to approximately 3,000 lb, the SDC
declares a wing transfer failure, cancels wing balance
logic, and reinitiates transfer from the good internal wing
tank.
• All fuel from the failed internal wing tank should gravity
transfer with the aid of bank angle changes or a steady
sideslip.
• Selecting INTR WING INHIBIT isolates normal wing
transfer/ refuel and diverts recirculation fuel to the feed
tanks.
TANK 1 TRANSFER FAILURE
• Tank 1 fails to stop transfer (pump and/or valve failure)
• Tank 1 depletes as soon as the feed tanks can accept its
fuel causing FUEL XFER caution.
• Assuming normal Tank 4 transfer, caution is removed
when Tank 4 depletes to approximately 2,100 lb.
TANK 4 TRANSFER FAILURE
• Tank 4 fails to transfer (pump failure).
• Tank 1 also stops transferring when it reaches the fuel
transfer schedule (approximately 1,000 lb).
• Tank 4 continuously gravity transfers to Tank 3 and,
when feed tank balance logic is initiated, to Tank 2 using
scavenge pump.

AHRS ONE OR TWO CHANNEL FAILURE
• FCCs have detected a failure of AHRS rate or

For each failed channel, rate sensor failures will

Loss of one or two AHRS channels will not affect

Loss of redundancy in rate and acceleration
information to the FCCs is the primary concern for
a two channel failure. Although there is no
degradation in flying qualities, subsequent AHRS
failures could lead to controllability problems if the
two channel AHRS failure procedures are not
followed.
It is possible that a third AHRS channel has failed
but is not detected. Flying qualities will be
degraded for this situation and will include poor
roll coordination for large lateral inputs, pitch
coupling, and sluggish pitch response. If flying
qualities are degraded, assume a four channel

AHRS FOUR CHANNEL FAILURE
• FCCs have detected a failure of AHRS rate or
acceleration data in three or four channels.
For each failed channel, rate sensor failures will
occur in all three sensor axes (Xs in CAS P, CAS R,
and CAS Y) and acceleration sensor failures will
occur in both sensor axes (Xs in N ACC and L

It is possible to experience a three channel failure
with only two channels Xd out. Flying qualities will
be degraded for this situation.
A detected loss of a third AHRS channel will result
in all four AHRS channels being Xd out. Three
columns of Xs will not be displayed because the
FCCs cannot determine the good channel.
Below 20,000 feet, flying qualities are best between
190-210 KCAS. Pitch and directional damping will
be very low and roll coordination will be weak.
• With a four channel AHRS failure, the aircraft is
not controllable with the flaps in HALF or FULL.
At altitudes above 25,000 feet, loss of control will
occur below Mach 0.92. For loss of AHRS above
25,000 feet, maintain airspeed above Mach 0.92

AILERON ACTUATOR FAILURE
• Aileron failures may be caused by an actuator
failure (mechanical or two channel failure) or by
a switching valve failing to switch to the backup
circuit following a HYD circuit failure.
Speedbrake function and autopilot inoperative.
• Failed aileron surface driven to a faired position
by air loads and damped to prevent oscillations.
• Expect slightly higher approach speeds. For Flaps
FULL approach speed will be increased by about
11 knots. Flaps HALF 17 knots.
• Avoid overcontrolling lateral stick inputs as it can
cause lateral PIO especially when approaching
touchdown.
• Operating aileron continues to provide roll

• FCCs have detected an excessive split between

With an AOA caution set, HUD displayed AOA
may be grossly in error and should not be utilized
to control aircraft flyaway.
• AOA caution can only be activated within 12
seconds after WoffW. With AOA caution set:
- During first 12 seconds, FCCs utilize a fixed
gain (on−speed AOA) for pitch axis control, so
expected flying qualities should be fairly
nominal.
- Movement of FLAP switch does not change flap
scheduling (e.g. flaps stay down).
- After 12 seconds, caution is removed even if
failure remains.
• After 12 seconds, if failure remains, an FCS
caution is set along with Xs in all four AOA
channels.
- HUD displayed AOA value is the average of the
two split AOA probes.

(15° in flaps AUTO or 5.5° to 15° in flaps
HALF/FULL depending on sideslip).
• Mismatch may be caused by a transient

FLAPS AUTO
• If the probe split clears, the AOA Xs are
automatically removed. The split/AOA Xs may
re-appear when/if the split conditions reoccur.
• With an AOA failure, FCCs use the AOA
estimator for gain scheduling.
• Flying qualities should be essentially normal
provided aircrew avoid high AOAs.
FLAPS HALF/FULL
• Rudder toe-in is disabled.
• FCCs use a fixed gain of 8.1°.
• HUD AOA, E-bracket and AOA indexers can be
restored by selecting GAIN ORIDE and boxing
the valid AOA probe on the FCS page.
• If an AOA probe is stuck or damaged (IFR
basket impact, bird strikes, probe icing), AOA
errors may be unannunciated if the AOA split
thresholds are not exceeded.
• Bolters in GAIN ORIDE or with AOA failed
require positive aft stick during rotation; 1/2 aft
stick is recommended. Deflections of less than
1/2 aft stick will result in excessive settle during
bolters.
In GAIN ORIDE, AOA will tend to readily
increase above 14° when decelerating from a
trimmed on-speed condition. Timely longitudinal
stick inputs will be required to prevent excessive
sink rates and correct a deceleration as power

LEF FAILURE
• LEF failures may be caused by an actuator failure (mechanical or two channel failure)
or by a switching valve failing to switch to the backup circuit following a HYD circuit
failure.
Speedbrake function and autopilot inoperative.
• Failed LEF surface is mechanically locked in its current position.
- Opposite LEF held frozen by FCCs except for differential control in flaps AUTO.
• In most cases, LEFs should be fairly symmetric; however, multiple FCS reset attempts
may aggravate the asymmetry.
• With a LEF locked near 21° LED (± 5°):
- Flaps HALF/FULL handling qualities essentially normal.
- If locked above this position, stall margin reduced.
• With LEF locked near 0° LED (± 5°):
- Light to moderate buffet levels persist for AOAs above on−speed (Buffet more
pronounced with LEF deflections significantly less than normal scheduled positions).
- Selecting flaps FULL not recommended due to higher buffet levels at lower AOAs
than with flaps HALF.
ROLL AND LINE-UP CONTROL
• Expect slight roll-off (1-3°) due to buffet and/or AOA/pitch attitude changes. Roll off
will not significantly degrade line-up control.
• A small roll-off will occur with airspeed changes during wave-off or bolter that is
easily controllable with small lateral stick inputs.
GLIDESLOPE CONTROL
• Glideslope control degradations may be more pronounced depending on frozen LEF
position. Wing stores will further degrade glideslope control.
• Power corrections will translate into an airspeed change before a rate of descent
change is noticed. This may lead to a tendency to over control glideslope. Anticipatory
throttle inputs are key to glideslope control.
• Time to achieve positive rate of climb is longer during a bolter/waveoff due to sluggish
throttle response. Climb-out attitude will appear flatter than normal.
• When operating shipboard, the waveoff window for all LEF failure conditions should
be moved farther out and the LSOs should be made aware of the degraded glideslope
performance.
GAIN ORIDE CONSIDERATIONS
FLAPS AUTO
• GAIN ORIDE will drive the unfailed LEF to a fixed position of 5° LED in AUTO. If
the failed LEF is near 21°, this will cause a controllable but undesirable LEF split.
Therefore, only select GAIN ORIDE if TEF retraction is essential or if the LEFs are
fixed near 5° LED.
• If fuel or range is a concern, momentary selection of GAIN ORIDE brings the TEFs
up to 4° TED and then returns them to normal scheduling when NORM is selected.
FLAPS HALF/FULL
• GAIN ORIDE will drive the unfailed LEF to a fixed position of 21° LED in
HALF/FULL. If the failed LEF is near 0° LED, this will cause a controllable LEF
split.
• Bolters in GAIN ORIDE or with AOA failed require positive aft stick during rotation;
1/2 aft stick is recommended. Deflections of less than 1/2 aft stick will result in
excessive settle during bolters.
• Exceeding GAIN ORIDE airspeed limitations of 350 KCAS (flaps AUTO), 200 KCAS
(flaps HALF), or 190 KCAS (flaps FULL) may result in an uncontrollable aircraft.
In GAIN ORIDE, AOA will tend to readily increase above 14° when decelerating from a
trimmed on-speed condition. Timely longitudinal stick inputs will be required to prevent
excessive sink rates and correct a deceleration as power alone will not change the AOA
or pitch attitude sufficiently in GAIN ORIDE. Alpha tone is disabled in GAIN ORIDE

TEF FAILURE
• TEF failures may be caused by an actuator failure (mechanical or three-four
channel failure) or by a dual HYD 1A/2B circuit failure.
Speedbrake function and autopilot inoperative.
• If a TEF actuator is shutdown, the surface is hydraulically or aerodynamically
driven to 5° TED and locked.
• If/when left versus right TEF asymmetry exceeds 6°, the opposite TEF turns
off and is also driven to 5° TED and locked.
• With both TEFs locked at 5° TED, drag is significantly reduced, approach
speeds are significantly higher, and on-speed power settings are near idle.
• A 10° AOA approach is required to attain acceptable approach throttle
response nearing touchdown.
• Approach speeds for shore landing may be near the maximum nose tire speed
(195 KGS). If making an arrested landing take maximum arresting gear
engagement speed into consideration.
• Expect slower engine response to throttle changes.
• Flying a 10° AOA approach reduces approach speed and increases approach
power setting slightly.
- Aircraft easily trims to and maintains 10° AOA. Expect normal flying
qualities.
• Sight picture behind the ship is altered, but field of view over the nose is not
degraded.
• Due to large difference between wind over the deck requirements at on-speed
and 10° AOA, it is imperative that AOA be maintained at 10°.
- Tendency exists to relax AOA control while maintaining glideslope.
GLIDESLOPE CONTROL
• Aircraft response to power corrections is sluggish and small in magnitude.
• Power corrections will translate into an airspeed change before a rate of descent
change is noted.
• Expect larger, longer, and more anticipatory power corrections to be required in
order to effect a glideslope change. Aggressive, well-timed, and anticipatory
throttle inputs are key to glideslope control.
• There is a tendency to over control power due to the low approach power
setting and the longer time required to effect a change.
• Time to achieve positive rate of climb is longer during a bolter/waveoff due to
sluggish throttle response. Climb-out attitude will appear flatter than normal.
Slower engine response to throttle changes may result in excessive
sink rates under high WOD conditions. The recovery WOD should
be kept as close as possible to the Aircraft Recovery Bulletin
recommendations.

RUDDER ACTUATOR FAILURE
• Rudder failures may be caused by an actuator
failure (mechanical or two channel failure) or by
a switching valve failing to switch to the backup
circuit following a HYD circuit failure.
Speedbrake function, autopilot, and rudder toe-in
inoperative.
• Following rudder actuator failure, surface driven
to a faired position by air loads and is damped to
prevent oscillations.
• Counter any roll-off with rudder. Countering a
roll-off with lateral stick alone increases adverse
yaw and aggravates the roll-off.
• To ensure balanced flight, minimize sideslip by
the early use of the operating rudder.
LINEUP CONSIDERATIONS
• Lineup control will be degraded.
• Make lineup corrections slowly and smoothly,
particularly when single engine.
Full opposing rudder may not be sufficient to
prevent a departure when single engine if MAX
power selected. Large single engine throttle
transients can cause significant yaw and roll.
• Departure resistance is degraded above on-speed

HYD Cautions
INDICATOR • CAUSE / REMARKS CORRECTIVE ACTION
HYD 1A
HYD 2B
• Dual HYD circuit failure (<1,400 psi).
Flight control surfaces affected:
• Both TEFs lost
• Right rudder lost (faired and damped)
• Right stabilator lost
With HYD 2B failed:
• No hook retraction
Left and/or right AIL Xs will occur if switching valve is slow/fails to
switch.
• FCS RESET recovers surface only if hydraulic pressure present.
Remarks for any surface off:
• General Limits:
• 10° AOA for flaps AUTO
• On-speed AOA for flaps HALF/FULL
• 2g max
• Minimize sideslip
• Half lateral stick
• Loss of speedbrake
• Loss of autopilot
Remarks for TEF/STAB/RUD Xs:
Full opposing rudder may not be sufficient to prevent a departure when single engine if MAX power selected. Large single
engine throttle transients can cause significant yaw and roll.
• TEF driven to 5° TED and locked.
• Approach speeds are significantly higher and on-speed power settings are near idle.
• Approach speeds for field landing may be near the maximum nose
tire speed (195 KGS).
Expect slower engine response to throttle changes which may
result in excessive sink rates under high WOD conditions. The
recovery WOD should be kept as close as possible to the Aircraft Recovery Bulletin recommendations.
• Aircraft response to power corrections is sluggish and small in
magnitude. Power corrections will translate into an airspeed
change before a rate of descent change is noted. Expect larger,
longer, and more anticipatory power corrections to be required in
order to effect a glideslope change. Aggressive, well-timed, and
anticipatory throttle inputs are key to glideslope control.
• There is a tendency to over-control power due to the low approach power setting and the longer time required to effect a
change.
• Time to achieve positive rate of climb is longer during a bolter/
waveoff due to sluggish throttle response. Climb-out attitude will
appear flatter than normal.
• Rudder toe-in is removed. Bolter performance degraded.
Because of right rudder and stabilator loss, bolter performance
will be degraded due to the lack of rudder toe-in and aircraft
yawing left, into good stab, when stab deflects TEU in preparation for nose rotation. Yaw rate may be sudden and pronounced,
but controllable using rudder/NWS.
• Counter any roll-off with rudder. Countering roll-off with lateral
stick alone increases adverse yaw and aggravates roll-off.
• Line-up control is degraded. Make slow and smooth line-up corrections (especially if single engine).
• Departure resistance is degraded above on-speed AOA.
High approach speeds will likely
preclude CV landing. Divert if able.

Remarks for LEF/STAB/RUD Xs:
Full opposing rudder may not be sufficient to prevent a
departure when single engine if MAX power selected. Large
single engine throttle transients can cause significant yaw
and roll.
• Stall margin reduced for LEF locked above 5° LED.
• Buffet likely with LEF near 0° at lower AOAs.
• Expect slight roll-off as airspeed changes during a waveoff or
bolter that is easily controllable.
• Glideslope control degradations may be more pronounced
depending on frozen LEF position. Wing stores will further
degrade glideslope control.
• Power corrections will translate into an airspeed change before
a rate of descent change is noticed. This may lead to a
tendency to over-control glideslope. Anticipatory throttle
inputs are key to glideslope control.
• Rudder toe-in is removed. Bolter/waveoff performance is
degraded and climb-out attitude will appear flatter than
normal.
Because of left rudder and stabilator loss, bolter
performance will be degraded due to the lack of rudder
toe-in and aircraft yawing right, into good stab, when stab
deflects TEU in preparation for nose rotation. Yaw rate
may be sudden and pronounced, and not easily controlled
because of failed left rudder and no normal NWS.

lateral stick alone increases adverse yaw and aggravates
roll-off.
• Line-up control is degraded. Make slow and smooth line-up
corrections (especially if single engine).
• Departure resistance is degraded above on-speed AOA.
• If AUTO is selected after being in flaps HALF or FULL, the
TEFs will not retract except for loads alleviation (no higher
than 17°). While in AUTO, momentary selection of GAIN
ORIDE will command the TEFs to retract to 4° TED.
However, the operating LEF will also be commanded to move
to 5° LED. This may drive a controllable but undesirable left
versus right LEF split if the failed LEF is not near 5° LED.
Therefore, only select GAIN ORIDE if TEF retraction is
essential for range or fuel considerations.

Full opposing rudder may not be sufficient to prevent a departure when single engine if MAX

Flaps HALF transition from a clean configuration
can be accomplished (expect a LWD roll near onspeed AOA). Carrier approach is possible but exhibits sloppy directional/centerline control. In the
event of a field bolter, the decision to go around
should be made immediately upon recognition of
a missed wire as rudder power may be insufficient
to maintain directional control below 140 KCAS.

HYD Cautions
INDICATOR • CAUSE / REMARKS CORRECTIVE ACTION
HYD 1A
HYD 1B
HYD 2B
• Triple HYD circuit failure (<1,400 psi).
Flight control surfaces affected:
• Both TEFs lost
• Left aileron lost (faired and damped)
• Right rudder lost (faired and damped)
• Right stabilator lost
With HYD 2B failed:
• No hook retraction
Remarks for any surface off:
• General Limits:
• 10° AOA for flaps AUTO
• On-speed AOA for flaps HALF/FULL
• 2g max
• Minimize sideslip
• Half lateral stick
• Loss of speedbrake
• Loss of autopilot
Remarks for AIL/RUD/STAB/TEF Xs:
• Full opposing rudder may not be sufficient to
prevent a departure when single engine if MAX
power selected. Large single engine throttle
transients can cause significant yaw and roll.
• Slower engine response to throttle changes may
result in excessive sink rates under high WOD
conditions. The recovery WOD should be kept
as close as possible to the Aircraft Recovery
Bulletin recommendations.
• Expect loose and sluggish response in flaps HALF,
with high approach speeds due to TEF failure.
• Expect slightly higher approach speeds.
• Avoid over-controlling lateral stick inputs as it can
cause lateral PIO especially when approaching touchdown.
• Rudder toe-in is removed. Bolter performance degraded.
Because of right rudder and stabilator loss, bolter
performance will be degraded due to the lack of
rudder toe-in and aircraft yawing left, into good
stab, when stab deflects TEU in preparation for
nose rotation. Yaw rate may be sudden and pronounced, but controllable with rudder/NWS.
• Counter any roll-off with rudder. Countering roll-off
with lateral stick alone increases adverse yaw and
aggravates roll-off.
• Line-up control is degraded. Make slow and smooth
line-up corrections (especially if single engine).
• TEF driven to 5° TED and locked.
• Approach speeds are significantly higher and onspeed power settings are near idle.
• Approach speeds for field landing may be near the
maximum nose tire speed (195 KGS). If making an
arrested landing, take maximum arresting gear engagement speed into consideration.
• Expect slower engine response.
CONTINUED
High approach speeds will likely preclude CV
landing. Divert if able. If HYD1 HOT caution
appears, consider securing left engine until
preparing for landing. Departure is probable if
left engine is secured.
1. Throttle LEFT engine - IDLE

control.
• There is a tendency to over-control power due to the

• Stall margin reduced for LEF locked above 5° LED.
• Buffet likely with LEF near 0° at lower AOAs.
• Power corrections will translate into an airspeed

This may lead to a tendency to over-control glideslope. Anticipatory throttle inputs are key to glideslope control.
• Bolter/waveoff performance is degraded and climbout attitude will appear flatter than normal.
• Departure resistance is degraded above on-speed
AOA.
• If AUTO is selected after being in flaps HALF or
FULL, the TEFs will not retract except for loads alleviation (no higher than 17°). While in AUTO, momentary selection of GAIN ORIDE will command
the TEFs to retract to 4° TED. However, the operating LEF will also be commanded to move to 5° LED.
This may drive a controllable but undesirable left

5° LED. Therefore, only select GAIN ORIDE if TEF
retraction is essential for range or fuel considerations.

13.4 GROUND FIRE
Several fire conditions exist that may be detected and signalled by ground crew without corresponding cockpit FIRE indications. These may include, for example, APU exhaust torching, ignition of fuel
or other flammable liquids exposed to hot surfaces, or brake fires. Aircraft location and the nature of
the fire condition will determine the course of action. In most cases, if ground crew signal a fire
condition, the aircraft should be stopped and shut down immediately. If a fire occurs during hot
refueling, the pilot must decide whether to taxi clear or shut down immediately.
13.4.1 HOT BRAKES/BRAKE FIRE. Hot brakes and/or melted wheel assembly fuse plugs can be
expected any time maximum effort braking is used at heavy gross weights with or without anti-skid,
e.g., aborted takeoff or heavy weight landing with high taxi brake usage.
There are basically two types of fires related to the brake system: flash fires and fires due to
continuous hydraulic fluid leakage onto hot brakes.
Brake flash fires are normally short in duration and self-extinguish. They can occur if excess grease
or residual/leaking hydraulic fluid have built up in the wheel brake assembly or on the carbon discs.
These materials may ignite at normal post-landing brake temperatures. Visible flames may extend
from the wheel assembly while flammable material is being consumed and smoke may be visible for a
short time after the fire goes out.
Continuous hydraulic fluid leakage coming into contact with hot brakes may result in a fire which
will not immediately self-extinguish. Setting the parking brake increases the rate of heat transfer from
the brakes to the wheel assembly which may lead to continuous hydraulic fluid leakage.
• Avoid setting the parking brake with hot brakes until the brake
assembly has cooled to prevent damage by heat and/or fire to the
brakes, wheel, tire, and landing gear components.
• If fire occurs with the parking brake set, the parking brake may
become non-operational and the aircraft may need to be chocked.
If hot brakes are suspected -
1. Continue to taxi to cool brakes (if practical).
2. DO NOT set parking brake.
3. Chock nosewheel (do not chock main wheels).
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-13-2 ORIGINAL
4. Park into the wind (if practical).
5. Cool brake assembly with ground cooling fan (if available).
If brake fire occurs -
1. Shut down both engines.
2. Chock nosewheel or PARK BRK handle - SET
3. Egress.
4. Ensure unnecessary ground personnel remain well clear of the aircraft.
13.5 EMERGENCY EGRESS
1. Canopy - OPEN (CANOPY switch, CANOPY JETT handle, or canopy handcrank)
CANOPY JETT rocket thrusters may ignite spilled fuel or hydraulic
fluid and may injure ground crew in the immediate vicinity.
NOTE
• The CANOPY switch should be used to raise the canopy unless there
are overriding circumstances. If weight is not on the left main gear
(e.g., gear up landing), the CANOPY switch must be held to raise the
canopy.
• In LOTs 21-25 aircraft the CANOPY JETT handle is the only means
of opening the canopy from the rear cockpit of the F/A-18F.
• If electrical power is not available, the canopy must be jettisoned or
raised with the handcrank.
2. Harness and leg restraints - RELEASE
NOTE
Several options exist for releasing the harness and leg restraints. (1) All
four harness buckles and all four leg restraints can be manually
released. (2) The upper Koch fittings can be manually released and the
manual override handle can be pulled to release the leg restraints and
the survival kit. The survival kit will be retained and may hamper
egress. (3) All four harness buckles can be manually released, and the
manual override handle can be pulled to release the leg restraints.
3. Oxygen/comm lead - DISCONNECT

4. EXIT THE COCKPIT
NOTE
If the boarding ladder has not been lowered, aircrew have several
alternatives, i.e., jump from the LEX (an approximately 8 ft drop),
slide down an extended TEF, or step down from the wing to an
installed wing tank/store.
13.6 BRAKE FAILURE/EMERGENCY BRAKES
The emergency brake system is powered by the brake accumulator or HYD 2B. Anti-skid protection
is bypassed when emergency brakes are selected or when the ANTI SKID switch is OFF. Normally
limited by the anti-skid system, 3,000 psi hydraulic brake pressure is available and regulated only by
pilot brake pedal forces. When using emergency brakes at high speed, initially apply very light brake
pedal pressure and gradually increase as required. There is a very small margin between effective
emergency braking and blown tires. If practical, rollout speed should be as slow as possible before
applying emergency brakes. The use of emergency brakes at high speeds should be considered a last
resort.
If detected after touchdown and flyaway airspeed available -
*1. Go Around.
If brake failure occurs at slow speed or flyaway airspeed not available -
*1. Brakes - RELEASE
*2. EMERG BRK handle - PULL TO DETENT
*3. Brakes - APPLY gradually

CHAPTER 14
Takeoff Emergencies
14.1 EMERGENCY CATAPULT FLYAWAY
After catapult launch, several emergencies may cause the aircraft to settle, e.g., slow catapult, AB
blowout, degraded engine performance, single engine total loss of thrust, improper trim setting, etc. If
settling cannot be stopped immediately, it is necessary to eject without delay. Priorities during
emergency catapult flyaway are to establish control of the aircraft, arrest aircraft settle, and accelerate
for climbout.
If a settle is detected, the throttles should be advanced to MAX as soon as possible. If the thrust
output of one engine is degraded, some yaw and roll should be expected. If one engine is failed
completely, significant amounts of yaw and roll result with both throttles at MAX. In this worst case,
full rudder pedal and partial lateral stick may be required to oppose yaw/roll and maintain
lateral-directional control of the aircraft. Too much rudder pedal is not harmful, but too little rudder
pedal may cause controllability problems. Therefore, FULL rudder pedal to oppose yaw/roll is
prudent.
Proper AOA control is crucial to maintaining aircraft control and to arresting aircraft settle. AOA
must be high enough to minimize altitude loss yet low enough to maintain lateral-directional control.
During a nominal, two-engine catapult launch, the aircraft is trimmed to capture and maintain a
reference AOA of 12° (hands off). The FCS does allow small overshoots during initial flyaway, but peak
AOA should typically be below 13°. Catapult launch bulletins ensure an endspeed at least 15 knots
above minimum controllable airspeed (Vmc). Vmc numbers for the F/A-18E/F launch bulletins are
defined at 14° AOA, which was selected as a compromise between arresting settle off the bow and
controllability. (Increased AOA helps arrest sink but also reduces lateral-directional controllability
resulting in higher minimum control speeds.) During single engine, MAX power catapult flyaway,
controllability should be sufficient if airspeed is above Vmc.
Under normal circumstances, proper AOA control should be provided by the FCS. However, certain
catapult failures (mis-trim, AOA probe splits or failures, FCS malfunctions) may require the pilot to
actively control flyaway pitch attitude/AOA. With an AOA malfunction, HUD displayed AOA may be
in error, so that pitch attitude becomes the only reliable source of AOA control. For this reason, the
recommended flyaway procedure is to maintain 10 to 12° pitch attitude with the waterline symbol
without exceeding 14° AOA (AOA tone). This should provide an AOA high enough to arrest the settle
yet low enough to retain lateral-directional control.
Depending on aircraft gross weight, stores jettison may be required to ensure a positive single engine
rate of climb (SEROC). Immediate jettison of excess weight minimizes altitude loss and, when
launching with a lateral weight asymmetry, returns the aircraft to a symmetric configuration,
potentially improving lateral-directional controllability.
It is also essential that the flaps remain in FULL until a positive rate of climb is established, as flap
retraction increases aircraft settle.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-14-1 ORIGINAL
The first four steps in the procedure are the most important to arrest settle and maintain control of
the aircraft. Raising the LDG GEAR handle reduces drag and allows a greater rate of climb; however,
attention should not be diverted from maintaining aircraft control to perform this action. The landing
gear should only be raised when the first four immediate action steps have been accomplished,
controllability is not in question, and raising the gear does not compound the emergency.
NOTE
When the LDG GEAR handle is raised, the on-speed AOA bracket is
removed from the HUD.
If flyaway airspeed available -
*1. Throttles - MAX
*2. Rudder pedal - FULL AGAINST YAW/ROLL
*3. EMERG JETT button - PUSH
*4. Maintain 10° to 12° pitch attitude with
W symbol.
• Do not exceed 14° AOA (AOA tone).
If unable to arrest yaw/roll or stop settle -
*5. EJECT
• Exceeding 10° to 12° pitch attitude may result in rapid loss of lateral
directional control.
• Raising flaps will increase aircraft settle.
14.2 ABORT
Maximum planned abort speed is dependent on ambient conditions, gross weight, runway length,
and runway and/or braking conditions. However, the decision to abort depends on the nature and
severity of the emergency.
Published maximum abort speeds for the existing conditions should allow the aircraft to be stopped
within the runway remaining without the use of long field arresting gear. For extreme emergencies, the
availability of long field arresting gear may influence the decision to abort. For other, less critical
emergencies, the decision to abort or continue the takeoff is crucial. Successfully stopping a heavy
weight aircraft on a high speed abort may prove to be a more extreme emergency than continuing a
takeoff with the given malfunction. No rule can be made to cover every situation, so good judgment and
common sense should be used. A thorough preflight briefing of abort contingencies should aid the pilot
in making a timely abort decision.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-14-2 ORIGINAL
Once the decision to abort is made, the amount of runway remaining dictates braking technique and
the decision to take any long field gear. After brakes are applied, stabilator braking with up to full aft
stick is extremely effective in aiding deceleration. At heavy takeoff gross weight, excessive brake
heating, melted wheel assembly fuze plugs, and/or blown tires should be anticipated. If the long field
gear is required to stop the aircraft, inform the tower and/or other members of the flight as soon as
possible. Lower the hook in time for it to fully extend. If the aircraft cannot be stopped in the runway
remaining, the decision whether or not to eject must be made. If in doubt, eject prior to the aircraft
leaving the prepared surface.
*1. Throttles - IDLE
*2. Speedbrake - AS DESIRED
*3. Brakes - APPLY
*4. Stick - AFT below 100 knots (if required)
*5. HOOK handle - DOWN (if required)
NOTE
A rule of thumb to ensure full hook extension is 1,000 feet prior to the
arresting gear.
14.3 GO AROUND
Several emergency situations may require the use of the Go Around procedure: FIRE light on takeoff
(engine fire), loss of thrust on takeoff (engine failure), or loss of directional control on takeoff or
landing (NWS or blown tire). The decision to abort or execute a go around depends on the nature and
severity of the emergency. Refer to the preceding ABORT discussion.
For a loss of directional control on landing, the decision to execute a go around should not be
delayed. In most cases, it is better to go around immediately than struggle with directional control and
possibly depart the runway. An immediate go around allows time to assess the emergency and set up
for an arrested landing, if required.
The Go Around procedure provides a quick, simple way to safely get airborne if a situation arises
which requires immediate action. The use of MIL or MAX power depends on airspeed, runway
remaining, and aircraft configuration/asymmetry. If one engine fails, asymmetric thrust effects are
exacerbated at MAX power but are nonetheless controllable if AOA is maintained near on-speed.
When safely airborne, raising the landing gear, if HYD 2A is operative, improves acceleration and
climb; however, it may not always be prudent depending on the nature of the emergency.
With the FLAP switch in HALF, SEROC is normally sufficient at all gross weights and ambient
conditions. However, if the situation warrants, jettisoning excess weight increases SEROC and, if
asymmetric, returns the aircraft to a symmetric configuration, potentially improving lateral-directional
controllability. See figure 14-1 for the maximum weight and altitudes for 100 fpm SEROC.
1. Throttles - MIL or MAX
2. Maintain ON-SPEED AOA and balanced flight.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-14-3 ORIGINAL
3. EMERG JETT button - PUSH (if required)
When single engine with the operating engine at MAX, the possibility of
an adverse yaw departure increases as AOA exceeds on-speed.
14.4 LOSS OF DIRECTIONAL CONTROL DURING TAKEOFF OR LANDING (BLOWN TIRE, NWS
FAILURE)
A directional control problem on takeoff or landing may be caused by a NWS, brake, landing gear
component failure, planing link failure or a blown tire. Directional control problems may be
compounded by wet or icy runways, crosswinds, hydroplaning, high lateral weight asymmetries, or
single-engine operations. It may be difficult to identify the source of the problem, and time is usually
Figure 14-1. Maximum Weight for 100 fpm Single Engine Rate of Climb
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-14-4 ORIGINAL
critical. The decision whether to continue a takeoff or to abort, or on landing, to continue rollout
depends on the speed at the time the directional control problem is detected, the stopping distance
required, and the availability of arresting gear.
Loss of brakes may be caused by a brake or anti-skid system failure. A brake system failure may
cause a locked brake and/or blown tire, resulting in ineffective braking and/or loss of directional
control. A blown tire may cause engine FOD or flap and gear door damage. If decision to stop is made,
the primary danger is loss of directional control. For Planing Link Failure Procedures, refer to chapter
16.
If the decision to takeoff is made, nose rotation and/or takeoff may be
delayed by abnormal aircraft attitudes due to failures, increased drag,
and lack of or reduced rudder toe due to rudder deflection to counter
directional motion.
If detected after touchdown and flyaway airspeed available -
*1. Go Around
If flyaway airspeed not available -
*1. Select emergency brakes (if appropriate).

V-14-6 ORIGINAL
CHAPTER 15
Inflight Emergencies
15.1 AFTERBURNER FAILURE
Afterburner failure can be recognized by failure of the nozzle to open, which may be the only
symptom that is immediately recognizable. The afterburner receives continuous ignition any time the
throttle is above the MIL detent and afterburner lightoff is not yet detected. If an afterburner does not
light after selection or blows out, reduce the throttle to MIL and reselect afterburner. If an afterburner
fails to light on subsequent attempts, maintenance action is most likely required.
15.2 RESTART
Ignition is activated automatically whenever a flameout is sensed and the throttle is at or above IDLE. At
least 350 KCAS is required to maintain 12% rpm for a windmill airstart. When single engine, the hydraulic
system switches from 3,000 to 5,000 psi output pressure above approximately 500 KCAS/1.0 IMN (see figure
15-2). This results in additional horsepower extraction and reduced windmill rpm. The hydraulic system
output drops from 5,000 to 3,000 psi at approximately 480 KCAS/0.95 IMN. Therefore, maintain airspeed
below 480 KCAS/0.95 IMN to maximize the chance of a successful windmill restart.
Continuing automatic restart attempts at high altitude or high AOA may cause the engine to
overtemp. In this case, place the throttle OFF until in a better start environment. The optimum restart
envelope is below 25,000 feet. If the engine is shut down from a high power setting and rpm decays to
0%, temporary rotor binding may occur. In this case, engine rotation will not be regained until the
engine cools evenly (about 10 to 15 minutes). Windmill restart attempts made after rpm has degraded
to 0% may require up to 450 knots to obtain 12% rpm for ignition.
APU restart is the last alternative. If APU restart is required, HYD ISOL ORIDE should first be
selected for 10 seconds prior to APU start, assuming good HYD 2B. With the APU switch ON, and the
green READY light on, the engine crank switch may be used to crank the engine for restart. The APU
restart envelope is below 250 KCAS, below 10,000 ft. See figures 15-1 through 15-4.
Attempting to restart an engine that has flamed out for no apparent
reason may result in an engine bay fuel leak/fire.
If rpm above 30% -
1. Throttle affected engine - IDLE or above
If rpm below 30% -
1. Throttle good engine - 80% N2 rpm minimum.
2. ENG CRANK switch - L or R (affected side)
3. Throttle affected engine - IDLE or above
4. Monitor EGT during start (871°C maximum). FADEC will not prevent hot starts airborne.

15.3 FUSELAGE FUEL LEAK
The possibility of fire is normally of prime concern with any fuel leak; however, with a massive leak,
the fuel loss itself must be dealt with promptly and correctly to ensure that sufficient fuel remains to
return to base. Fuel loss rates can be in excess of 1,000 ppm from failed main fuel lines. Left unchecked,
this leak can rapidly drain external tanks, both transfer tanks, and the feed tank on the leaking side.
Since leaks may occur upstream of the throttle-operated fuel shutoff valve in the fuel control, shutting
down the throttle may not stop the leak. Pressing the corresponding FIRE light closes the feed tank
fuel shutoff valve for that engine and stops fuel flow through the main fuel line.
The pilot may not be able to visually determine which side is leaking. Utilize a wingman, when
available, and check for secondary indications to determine the side of the leak. In addition to the
primary cockpit indications listed in the procedure, the following may also be indications of a fuselage
fuel leak: FUEL LO caution, erratic engine operation at high power settings, abnormal fuel flow
indications.
1. Afterburners - DESELECT
Afterburner operation with a fuselage fuel leak may result in a fire.
2. Analyze indications to determine which side is leaking:
• Visual confirmation of fuel leakage
• L or R BOOST LO caution
• FEED tank imbalance (lower feed tank)
• FUEL LO caution (lower feed tank)
• Erratic engine operation
If unable to confirm side -
3. Land as soon as possible.
If side confirmed -
3. Throttle affected engine - OFF
4. FIRE light affected engine - PUSH
Securing the good engine may result in flameout of both engines.
If fuel leak stops -
5. Land as soon as practical.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-15-4 ORIGINAL
If fuel leak continues -
6. Land as soon as possible.
FOR LANDING (leak continues) -
1. Make normal vice arrested landing (if possible).
2. Use light braking.
After landing3. Turn aircraft into the wind.
4. Throttles - OFF
5. FIRE lights - PUSH
15.4 HYDRAULIC FAILURES
Hydraulic failures are indicated by the HYD 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B circuit cautions described in
Chapter 12. The effects of losing one or more HYD circuits can be seen by analyzing the Hydraulic
Flow Diagram shown in figure 15-5. For multiple hydraulic circuit failures, the Hydraulic Subsystems
Malfunction Guide (figure 15-6) shows which flight control surfaces are lost. Remarks regarding the
flight control effects due to hydraulic failures are shown in figure 15-7.

FLIGHT CONTROL EFFECTS DUE TO HYDRAULIC FAILURES
Flight Control Failure1 REMARKS
Any Surface Off D General Limits:
D 10° AOA for flaps AUTO
D On-speed AOA for flaps HALF/FULL
D 2g max
D Minimize sideslip
D Half lateral stick
D Loss of speedbrake
D Loss of autopilot
AIL Xs D Expect slightly higher approach speeds. For flaps FULL, approach speed
will be increased by about 11 knots. Flaps HALF, 17 knots.
D Avoid over-controlling lateral stick inputs as it can cause lateral PIO especially when approaching touchdown.
RUD Xs
Full opposing rudder may not be sufficient to prevent a departure
when single engine if MAX power selected. Large single engine
throttle transients can cause significant yaw and roll.
D Rudder toe-in is removed. Bolter performance degraded.
D Counter any roll-off with rudder. Countering roll-off with lateral stick
alone increases adverse yaw and aggravates roll-off.
D Line-up control is degraded. Make slow and smooth line-up corrections
(especially if single engine).
D Departure resistance is degraded above on-speed AOA.
LEF Xs D Opposite LEF held frozen. TEFs held frozen in flaps AUTO.
D Stall margin reduced for LEF locked above 5° LED.
D Buffet likely with LEF near 0° at lower AOAs.
D Expect slight roll-off as airspeed changes during a waveoff or bolter that
is easily controllable.
D Glideslope control degradations may be more pronounced depending on
frozen LEF position. Wing stores will further degrade glideslope control.
D Power corrections will translate into an airspeed change before a rate of
descent change is noticed. This may lead to a tendency to over-control
glideslope. Anticipatory throttle inputs are key to glideslope control.
D Bolter/waveoff performance is degraded and climb-out attitude will appear flatter than normal.
D If AUTO is selected after being in flaps HALF or FULL, the TEFs will
not retract except for loads alleviation (no higher than 17°). While in
AUTO, momentary selection of GAIN ORIDE will command the TEFs to
retract to 4° TED. However, the operating LEF will also be commanded
to move to 5° LED. This may drive a controllable but undesirable left
versus right LEF split if the failed LEF is not near 5° LED. Therefore,
only select GAIN ORIDE if TEF retraction is essential for range or fuel
considerations.
Note: (1) Surface inoperative due to lack of hydraulic pressure.

FLIGHT CONTROL EFFECTS DUE TO HYDRAULIC FAILURES (CONT)
Flight Control Failure(1) REMARKS
STAB Xs
During a bolter, aircraft yaws into good stabilator when the flight control system deflects the good stabilator TEU in preparation for aircraft nose rotation. Yaw rate may be sudden and pronounced.
D In flaps AUTO, max roll rate is extremely low in the transonic region below 20,000 feet, especially when rolling away from the failed stabilator.
TEF Xs
Slower engine response to throttle changes may result in excessive
sink rates under high WOD conditions. The recovery WOD should
be kept as close as possible to the Aircraft Recovery Bulletin recommendations.
D TEF driven to 5° TED and locked.
D Approach speeds are significantly higher and on-speed power settings are
near idle.
D Approach speeds for field landing may be near the maximum nose tire
speed (195 KGS). If making an arrested landing, take maximum arresting
gear engagement speed into consideration.
D Expect slower engine response.
D Aircraft response to power corrections is sluggish and small in magnitude.
Power corrections will translate into an airspeed change before a rate of
descent change is noted. Expect larger, longer, and more anticipatory
power corrections to be required in order to effect a glideslope change.
Aggressive, well-timed, and anticipatory throttle inputs are key to glideslope control.
D There is a tendency to over-control power due to the low approach power
setting and the longer time required to effect a change.
D Time to achieve positive rate of climb is longer during a bolter/waveoff
due to sluggish throttle response. Climb-out attitude will appear flatter
than normal.
Note: (1) Surface inoperative due to lack of hydraulic pressure.

15.5 DOUBLE TRANSFORMER-RECTIFIER FAILURE
Failure of both transformer-rectifiers (TRs) can be recognized by loss of the HUD (but not the other
displays), bleed air including cockpit airflow/pressurization, and other equipment which operates on
the main dc busses. The FCC channels continue to be powered by their respective PMG outputs. The
Essential Bus is powered by the EBB PMGs with the battery charger and the battery as backups.
Therefore, the battery gauge should read greater than 24 vdc (26.5 nominal) and the BATT SW caution
light should be out.
With a dual TR failure, time is not critical, and essential bus equipment need not be turned off.
Equipment requiring ac power only will remain operable with a dual TR failure and need not be turned
off to conserve battery power. If the L or R DC FAIL caution lights illuminate, all three 28 volt dc
windings from the corresponding PMG are prevented from supplying FCC CH or essential bus backup
power. See the Emergency Power Distribution Charts (figure 15-8) for operative and inoperative
equipment.
1. BATT SW caution light - CONFIRM OUT
2. Electrical RESET button - PRESS
3. Maintain airspeed below 325 KCAS (300 to 325 KCAS optimum).
4. ECS MODE switch - OFF/RAM
5. AV COOL switch - EMERG
6. CABIN PRESS switch - RAM/DUMP
7. OBOGS control switch - OFF
8. Maintain altitude below 10,000 feet MSL prior to emergency oxygen depletion (10 to 20 minutes).
9. Consider removing mask and resetting emergency oxygen system once below 10,000 feet MSL.
10. Land as soon as practical.
If AV AIR HOT caution appears -
11. Non-essential avionics equipment - OFF (e.g., RADAR, UFCD controlled avionics, ECM,
sensors, MC2)
12. Land as soon as possible.
For landing -
13. Perform Landing Gear Emergency Extension procedure.
14. Make a short field arrestment (if available).
15. Use emergency brakes with steady brake pressure. (Anti-skid is not available.)

15.6 COCKPIT TEMPERATURE HIGH
Hot cockpit airflow may be caused by an ECS control failure or a valve failure. Selecting full COLD
on the CABIN TEMP knob should shut off warm air to the cockpit. If this procedure fails to secure
warm air to the cockpit, then the failure is most likely with the cockpit flow valve itself. If this is the
case, securing both BLEEDS may be the only means to stop the flow of warm air.
Selection of MAN with the ECS MODE switch is prohibited. Selection of
MAN while the aft cooling fan shutoff valve is open may cause the fan to
overspeed resulting in a catastrophic fan failure potentially leading to loss
of OBOGS.
1. CABIN TEMP knob - FULL COLD
If temperature still high -
2. Maintain altitude below 25,000 feet.
3. CABIN PRESS switch - RAM/DUMP
If temperature not reduced -
4. Emergency oxygen green ring - PULL
5. OXY FLOW knob - OFF
6. BLEED AIR knob - OFF (DO NOT CYCLE)
7. Maintain altitude below 10,000 feet MSL prior to emergency oxygen depletion (10 to 20 minutes).
Under less than optimal conditions (low altitude, heavy breathing, loose
fitting mask, etc.) as few as 3 minutes of emergency oxygen may be
available.

MC2)
16. Land as soon as possible.
15.7 COCKPIT SMOKE, FUMES, OR FIRE
Consider all unidentified fumes in the cockpit as toxic. Do not confuse condensation from the ECS
with smoke. The most probable source of visible smoke or fumes in the cockpit is from the engine bleed
air or residual oil in the ECS ducts. This smoke is blue gray in color, has a characteristic pungent odor,
and may cause the eyes to sting. Another source of smoke or fumes is an electrical malfunction or
overheat of equipment located in the cockpit. In the event of an electrical short or overload condition,
this equipment may generate electrical smoke (usually white or gray in color) but should not cause an
open fire since cockpit equipment uses very little electrical current. Cockpit electrical wiring insulation
may smolder and create smoke, but will not erupt into a seriously damaging fire.
*1. Emergency oxygen green ring(s) - PULL
*2. OXY FLOW knob(s) - OFF
*3. Initiate rapid descent to below 10,000 feet cabin altitude.
*4. CABIN PRESS switch - RAM/DUMP
• DCS may be experienced when operating in an unpressurized cabin
above 25,000 feet even with a working oxygen system. Symptoms of
DCS include pain in joints, tingling sensations, dizziness, paralysis,
choking, and/or loss of consciousness.
• Under less than optimal conditions (low altitude, heavy breathing,
loose fitting mask, etc.) as few as 3 minutes of emergency oxygen may
be available.
5. Airspeed - Maintain 200 to 300 KCAS.
6. OBOGS control switch - OFF
7. Maintain altitude below 10,000 feet MSL prior to emergency oxygen depletion (10-20 minutes).
8. Consider resetting emergency oxygen system once below 10,000 feet MSL.

If smoke and fumes still present -
9. BLEED AIR knob - OFF (DO NOT CYCLE.)
10. AV COOL switch - EMERG
11. EXT TANK switch(es) - STOP
If smoke and fumes persist or fire present -
12. All electrical equipment - OFF
13. UFCD controlled avionics - OFF (AC power is required.)
14. Required electrical equipment - ON
Restore power to equipment one at a time. If smoke/fire starts again, secure that equipment.
If still unable to clear smoke -
15. Slow and jettison canopy. Secure all loose articles and ensure helmet visor is down. In the
F/A-18F, the rear crewmember should lower the seat and lean as far forward as possible before
jettisoning canopy.
15.8 HYPOXIA/LOW MASK FLOW/NO MASK FLOW
*1. Emergency oxygen green ring(s) - PULL
*2. OXY FLOW knob(s) - OFF
*3. Initiate rapid descent to below 10,000 feet cabin altitude.
Under less than optimal conditions (low altitude, heavy breathing, loose
fitting mask, etc.) as few as 3 minutes of emergency oxygen may be
available.
4. OBOGS control switch - OFF
5. Maintain cabin altitude below 10,000 feet prior to emergency oxygen depletion (10 to 20
minutes).
If hypoxia symptoms persist -
6. Remain on emergency oxygen as long as possible.
7. Land as soon as possible.
If hypoxia symptoms removed -
6. Land as soon as practical.

operation if flow appears normal and donning of mask is desired once below 10,000 feet cabin
altitude.
15.9 LOSS OF CABIN PRESSURIZATION
Decompression sickness (DCS) becomes a physiological concern at exposures to cabin altitudes in
excess of 18,000 feet. The potential for DCS increases at exposures above 25,000 feet or in the case of
a rapid decompression. Aircrew exposed to these conditions should be alert for the symptoms of DCS.
*1. Emergency oxygen green ring(s) - PULL
*2. OXY FLOW knob(s) - OFF
*3. Initiate rapid descent to below 10,000 feet cabin altitude.
4. CABIN PRESS switch - CHECK NORM
5. ECS MODE switch - CHECK AUTO
DCS may be experienced when operating in an unpressurized cabin above
25,000 feet even with a working oxygen system. Symptoms of DCS
include pain in joints, tingling sensations, dizziness, paralysis, choking,
and/or loss of consciousness.
If DCS or hypoxia symptoms present -
6. Maintain altitude below 10,000 feet MSL.
7. Land as soon as possible.
If DCS or hypoxia symptoms not present -
6. Reset emergency oxygen system and resume normal OBOGS operation.
7. Maintain altitude below 25,000 feet MSL.
8. Land as soon as practical.
15.10 DISPLAY MALFUNCTION - NON-AMCD AIRCRAFT
If a display malfunctions, cycle power to attempt to restore normal functioning. HUD symbology is
provided by either DDI, with the LDDI as the primary driver. If the HUD malfunctions, consider also
cycling both DDI power knobs. The same holds true for the UFCD which is powered by the MPCD. If
a display continues to malfunction, turn it off to prevent an overheat.
If all displays are flashing, turn MC1 and MC2 off alternately to see if the problem clears. If one or
more displays are frozen with an accompanying MC1 or MC2 caution, turn off the failed MC. If all
displays then go blank, cycle power to the operating MC, then resecure the failed MC.

15.11 DISPLAY MALFUNCTION - AMCD AIRCRAFT
If a display malfunctions (stale data or DDI pushbuttons do not work), attempt to restore by cycling
display power. If cycling power to the display does not fix the problem, cycling the corresponding
mission computer may restore the DDI (cycle MC1 for LDDI, MC2 for RDDI). HUD symbology is
driven by either MC1 or MC2. If the UFCD malfunctions, attempt to restore by cycling the MPCD or
(LOT 26 AND UP) 8 x 10 display.
If all displays are flashing STANDBY, and a backup HUD is displayed in the front cockpit, a dual
MC failure has occurred.
15.12 DUAL MISSION COMPUTER (MC) FAILURE - AMCD AIRCRAFT
A dual MC failure is recognized by STANDBY flashing on the HUD and L/RDDIs. In the front
cockpit, a backup HUD format (driven by the SDC) is displayed on the MPCD and UFCD. After
cycling an MC, the corresponding display (LDDI for MC1, RDDI for MC2) continues to flash
STANDBY for approximately 11 seconds while the MC boots up.
1. MC switch - CYCLE TO 1 OFF, THEN TO 2 OFF
After 15 seconds, if MC1 is restored (MC1 Backup Mode) -
2. MC switch - MOVE FROM 2 OFF TO NORM
15.13 OUT-OF-CONTROL FLIGHT (OCF)
Selection of manual spin recovery mode (SPIN switch in RCVY) seriously degrades controllability, will prevent recovery from any departure
or spin, and is prohibited.
15.13.1 Departure from Controlled Flight. A typical F/A-18E/F departure occurs as a yaw divergence (nose-slice) followed by an uncommanded roll in the same direction. The yaw divergence can
happen very quickly; therefore, the yaw rate tone may not provide sufficient departure warning.
Usually, a departure is preceded by a slow buildup in sideslip and uncomfortable sideforces. The
buildup of sideslip is accompanied by ″vortex rumble″; however, vortex rumble may not be noticed
during aggressive maneuvering. Therefore, excessive sideforce provides the most reliable departure
warning cue to the pilot. The initial phase of the departure is not particularly violent or disorienting
unless it occurs at high airspeed or Mach number. Recognition of these cues permits neutralization of
the controls and avoidance of a departure.
15.13.1.1 Departures with Lateral Weight Asymmetries. Complying with NATOPS limits for
asymmetric store loadings is required to prevent departures. Aggressive longitudinal maneuvering
beyond NATOPS AOA limits may result in a yaw departure away from the heavy wing, which cannot
be controlled with lateral stick or pedal inputs. At low airspeed, recovery is immediate when AOA is
reduced below NATOPS limits. At higher airspeed, more violent and sudden departures may occur
with little or no warning when maneuvering aggressively beyond NATOPS limits. In such cases, the
resulting post-stall gyrations rapidly transition to an upright spin away from the heavy wing.
15.13.1.2 Departure Recovery. Recovery is generally very prompt, on release of the controls. Some
departures, particularly from inadvertent tailslides, may exhibit large transitory sideslips or negative
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-15-19 ORIGINAL
g rolls prior to positive recovery. Sideslip type departures yield excessive gravity-induced sideslip at
relatively slow airspeeds (
<90 KCAS) and can quickly develop into a spin. In the absence of a steady
spin arrow, controls should remain neutral throughout all such post departure motion, as CAS reliably
regains control. Any pilot input will delay recovery or precipitate further departure. For departure
recoveries that stabilize in a negative g stall, application of aft stick may be used to finish the recovery.
15.13.2 Spin. Spin is confirmed by a steady spin arrow or the presence of a sustained yaw rate,
elevated positive or negative AOA, and airspeed less than 150 KCAS. F/A-18E/F spin arrows very
reliably indicate the appropriate recovery action. While some departures may generate sufficient yaw
rate to trip the command arrow, they are typically self-recovering by the time the arrow is displayed,
and the arrow will quickly disappear. Therefore, with the spin arrow present, a brief hesitation is all
that is required to confirm a steady, valid arrow prior to applying anti-spin lateral stick.
15.13.2.1 Spin Recovery. The command arrow indicates the proper control stick position for
upright or inverted spins. For upright spins, the command arrow directs the pilot to apply full lateral
stick with the spin direction. For inverted spins, the command arrow directs the pilot to apply full
lateral stick opposite the spin direction. In general, spin recovery is straightforward and reliable if the
OCF procedures are followed and sufficient altitude remains. For lateral weight asymmetry loadings,
recoveries from upright spins away from the heavy wing are essentially identical to the symmetrical
loaded airplane. Spin recoveries for less common upright spins into the heavy wing, and inverted spins,
were sometimes delayed due to the oscillatory nature of the spin. Recovery begins immediately but
may take up to one turn to become apparent. Recovery from a fully developed spin may include high
roll rates with significant negative g unloads, which, though disorienting and uncomfortable, should be
interpreted as a positive indication of imminent recovery. When the command arrow is removed,
lateral stick should be smoothly returned to neutral. Maintaining anti-spin lateral stick after the
command arrow has disappeared may transition the recovering spin into a controllable roll that could
delay recovery.
15.13.3 OCF Recovery Procedures
*1. Controls - RELEASE, FEET OFF RUDDERS, SPEEDBRAKE IN
If still out of control -
*2. Throttles - IDLE
*3. Altitude, AOA, airspeed, and yaw rate - CHECK
If command arrow present -
*4. Lateral stick - FULL WITH ARROW
When command arrow removed -

When recovery indicated by AOA and yaw rate tones removed, side forces subsided, and
airspeed accelerating above 180 knots -
*6. Recover.

Failure to ensure all criteria are met may result in departure during
recovery.
Passing 6,000 ft AGL, dive recovery not initiated -
*7. Eject.
15.13.4 Post Departure Dive Recovery
• Recovery is indicated when AOA and YAW rate tones are removed,
side forces subside, and airspeed is accelerating above 180 knots.
Failure to ensure all criteria are met may result in redeparture during
recovery.
• Limit AOA to 10° during a recovery from departure caused by a flap
system failure/malfunction (FCS/FC AIR DAT/FLAPS OFF cautions) to avoid departing the aircraft. Departure warning is characterized by an uncommanded yaw/roll.
• Post departure dive recovery initiated below 6,000 feet AGL is not
assured. Delaying the ejection decision below 6,000 feet AGL while
departed may result in unsuccessful ejection.
1. One-g roll to the nearest horizon.
2. Throttles - MAX (MIL if altitude not critical)
3. Pull to and maintain 25° to 35° AOA until positive rate of climb established (AOA configuration
dependent).
A positive rate of climb requires wings level pitch attitude (waterline)
greater than indicated AOA.
If aircraft departs during dive recovery below 6,000 ft AGL -
4. Eject.

15.14 CONTROLLABILITY CHECK
Requirement: Malfunction, failure, or damage, which degrades approach and landing characteristics.
Purpose (to determine):
• Whether to attempt an approach or a controlled ejection.
• Safe landing configuration.
• Safe final approach airspeed/AOA.
1. Climb to and maintain a safe altitude in VMC:
• 15,000 feet AGL (recommended)
• At or above 5,000 feet AGL (if practical)
2. Coordinate a visual inspection (if possible).
3. Plan to configure aircraft and conduct controllability check as close to field/CV as possible
(avoid populated areas if able).
• In all cases, consider BINGO fuel requirements.
4. Reference the appropriate emergency procedure to plan the following:
• Normal or Emergency Landing Gear Extension
• Appropriate flap setting for controllability check and landing
• AOA and/or airspeed limitations
• Any controllability issues that may arise from landing gear and/or flap extension
• Desired landing gross weight and fuel dump plan
5. Consider Select Jettison stores prior to gear extension if:
• Lateral weight asymmetry is over 12,000 ft-lb to establish a more symmetric configuration
• Emergency Landing Gear extension required (i.e., no HYD 2A)
• Stated in appropriate emergency procedure
If single engine -
6. Reduce gross weight (44,000 lb max, lower if practical).
7. Maintain operating engine above 80% RPM during flap and landing gear extension.
8. Do not exceed 15° AOB in turns (if possible).
If normal landing gear extension possible (i.e., no HYD2A caution) -
9. Slow to below 250 KCAS.
10. LDG GEAR handle - DN
If normal landing gear extension not possible -
9. Execute Landing Gear Emergency Extension procedure.
• Do not configure flaps during Landing Gear Emergency Extension.
• Return to Controllability Check procedure once gear extended.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-15-22 ORIGINAL
Once landing gear down and locked -
10. DO NOT TRIM until minimum controllable airspeed is determined.
11. Crosscheck AOA and airspeed during decel.
12. FLAP switch − AUTO/HALF/FULL based on:
• Flap setting stated in appropriate emergency procedure
• If single engine, flaps HALF
• Consideration of type landing, failure/damage, engine performance, etc.
13. Determine minimum controllable airspeed by slowing in 10 knot increments.
• If still controllable at AOA limit stated in appropriate emergency procedure or on-speed, plan
on flying appropriate AOA for approach and landing.
• If one-half stick or rudder pedal deflection required to maintain balanced flight prior to AOA
limit stated in appropriate emergency procedure or on-speed, add 10 knots for airspeed to be
used during approach and landing.
• If lateral stick required for balanced flight, plan for turns in the direction of stick
displacement (if possible).
14. Assess:
• Controllability in a 15° AOB turn
• Throttle response and wave-off maneuver
If controllability unacceptable to attempt landing -
15. Consider a controlled ejection over an unpopulated area (if possible).
If controllability acceptable to attempt landing -
15. Fly a straight-in approach.
• Do not go slower than the minimum-controllable-airspeed-plus-10 knots, or equivalent AOA,
as determined during controllability check.
If single engine -
16. Execute Single Engine Approach and Landing procedure.
If dual engine -
16. Return to appropriate emergency procedure to ensure all corrective action steps are
completed prior to attempting approach to landing.
17. If arrested landing desired/required, consider effects of approach speed on max arrestinggear engagement speed.
18. If controllability changes or safe landing is not certain at any point on approach, execute
wave-off/missed approach immediately.

15.19 ANGLE OF ATTACK (AOA) FAILURE
The AOA values displayed on the FCS Status page on the DDI represent source-error corrected AOA
values, also referred to as True AOA values. In normal operation, the average of the Left and Right
True AOA values is used to drive the HUD AOA numeric value, E-bracket and indexer lights. The AOA
values on the FCS Status page remain displayed even if a probe is damaged or binding. Pilots can use
these displayed values at any time to determine the health of each probe by: comparing their values to
each other; performing an AOA/airspeed crosscheck; or comparing each value to the center AOA value
derived from INS data.
When flaps are in Up/Auto, the HUD AOA numeric value is equal to the average of the displayed
left and right AOA probe values until AOA exceeds approximately 45° (True AOA), at which time INS
based AOA estimations are used for display.
In Flaps Up/Auto, whenever a filtered difference of the left and right AOA probe values exceeds
about 10° (a 15.5° uncorrected, local AOA probe-split), the L-versus-R AOA monitor is tripped, a
four-channel AOA failure is declared, and the HUD AOA numeric value is blanked. In Flaps
HALF/FULL, whenever the filtered difference of the left and right AOA probe values exceeds the
failure threshold (with zero sideslip, about 3° true, 5.5° local AOA), a four-channel AOA failure is
declared, and the HUD E-bracket, AOA numeric value and indexer lights are blanked. In Flaps
HALF/FULL, the failure threshold is increased as a function of sideslip. With no sideslip, the failure
threshold is about 3°, but increases to approximately 10° with 15° of sideslip.

Effects

When the L-versus-R AOA monitor is tripped, the following will occur:
• FCS caution is annunciated
• HUD numeric value blanks
• AOA four-channel X-out is displayed on the FCS status page
• An X appears next to the altitude (indicating altitude is not corrected)
• Autopilot will not engage, or will disengage if currently engaged
When flaps are in HALF or FULL, additional indications are:
• ATC will not engage or will disengage if currently engaged
• HUD E-bracket is blanked
• AOA indexer lights and external approach lights are blanked
NOTE
The effects on ATC, HUD E-bracket, AOA indexer lights and external
approach lights, and autopilot will also occur if the unfiltered
difference in the left and right AOA probes exceeds a failure threshold
(with zero sideslip, about 3.4° true AOA) for at least 0.5 seconds.
15.19.1 AOA PROBE DAMAGE OR BINDING. Pilots should be alert for AOA probe damage or
binding. Typically, probe-damage is a result of an IFR basket strike, a bird strike or heater
malfunction. In the cruise configuration, the FCS software will only recognize a probe is damaged if
that damaged probe has an electrical malfunction or has a value that differs from the nondamaged
probe by more than the AOA failure-threshold of 10° true AOA (15.5° local AOA). If AOA probe
damage is suspected, an AOA/airspeed crosscheck in the landing configuration should be made (with
a wingman if possible). After transitioning to the landing configuration, conduct a wings-level
AOA/airspeed crosscheck as well as compare the FCS page L and R AOA probe values against the
center INS AOA value. Also make gentle, banked turns to ensure the L and R probes are tracking one
another. If a damaged probe is confirmed, execute the AOA Four-Channel Failure procedure.
NOTE
In flaps AUTO, an L-versus-R AOA failure is not latched. When the
displayed AOA 10° probe-split is no longer exceeded, the failure
annunciation will automatically clear and the HUD AOA numeric
value will return. This does not mean that both AOA probes are fully
functioning. It’s only an indication the probes are now back within at
least 10° of one another.
A binding probe, on the other hand, can occur at any time as a result of faulty cover installation,
manufacturing and/or environmental elements. The best defense against encountering a binding probe
is judicious execution of the AOA probe condition-check during the Exterior Inspection prior to
takeoff. Once airborne, whenever in the landing configuration, the best defense against a binding-probe
condition is routine AOA/airspeed crosschecks and an occasional FCS page L/R AOA probe crosscheck.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-15-45 ORIGINAL
In flight, a probe that is binding will typically only make itself apparent in the landing configuration,
during gentle, banked turns or wings-level flight, with airspeeds less than 145 KCAS. Binding that
causes the filtered difference in the left and right AOA probes to exceed 3° (true AOA) will result in
a four-channel X-out.
In flaps HALF/FULL, a L-versus-R AOA failure is latched. DO NOT
reset the four-channel AOA failure. When the 3° probe-split is no longer
exceeded, the failure annunication can be manually reset, but this does
not mean that both AOA probes are now properly functioning. It is only
an indication the probes are momentarily within at least 3° of one
another. It is highly likely that the binding-condition which initiated the
original failure still exists. When a failure annunciation is reset with an
FCS reset, the subsequent return of that failure will cause a reoccurrence
of the associated effects (such as loss of rudder toe-in, pitch down
transient). This may occur at an inopportune time such as just prior to
weight on wheels.
A binding probe can occasionally free-up, providing a valid reset window, but the probe will likely
bind again, and it may result in an insidious probe-split of less than 3° that is only detectable by an
AOA/airspeed crosscheck or judicious scan of the FCS page. If the failure annunciation is reset with an
FCS reset, any transients experienced with the first occurrence of the failure can reoccur when the
failure is subsequently annunciated. The appropriate reaction is to execute the AOA Four-Channel
Failure procedure. This procedure is designed to drive the pilot to select GAIN ORIDE, enabling the
ability to select the functional probe, once it is identified, to regain HUD displays. In addition, GAIN
ORIDE provides the pilot with a fixed AOA gain (nominal flying qualities) that is no longer dependent
on the health of the AOA probes, thereby providing immunity from further AOA failure anomalies. A
binding probe can also be intermittent or momentary. If, during an approach where autopilot and
auto-throttle modes are engaged, these modes will disengage if the FCCs detect a momentary AOA
split. Simultaneously, the HUD AOA numeric value, E-bracket and indexer lights will blank, even if
the split does not persist. If this occurs, be aware that a binding-probe condition or 4-channel AOA
failure may be imminent. A persistent split will annunciate a four channel AOA X-out.
15.19.2 AOA PROBE SELECTION AOA probe selection is only available when GAIN ORIDE is
engaged. The selected AOA probe is used to drive the HUD AOA numeric value, the E-bracket and
indexer/approach lights. This ensures that both the pilot and LSO have valid data displayed, but the
selected AOA does not drive or affect the flying qualities. However, the GAIN ORIDE mode does force
the control system to employ a fixed set of gains for AOA and air data.
Selection of an AOA probe can only be performed while in GAIN ORIDE and is accomplished by
pressing the push-tile on the digital display labeled AOA. The first pressing of the push-tile selects and
boxes the left AOA probe and the second pressing selects and boxes the right AOA probe. While a third
pressing boxes the center/INS value, that value cannot be selected to drive the HUD displays.
15.19.3 SINGLE AOA FAILURE ON TAKEOFF The FCC software monitors the AOA probe values
during takeoff to provide protection against a slow to rotate AOA probe and/or protection for a single
stuck AOA probe. The protection activates special logic that is only available during the 12 seconds
after lift-off. This logic was developed to allow a safe recoverable field and catapult takeoff. The special
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-15-46 ORIGINAL
processing logic is engaged if the difference between the left and right AOA probe values exceed the
instantaneous mismatch threshold after airspeed exceeds 117 KCAS with weight on wheels or during
the first 12 seconds following the transition to weight off wheels.. If this special logic is engaged, an
AOA caution is annunciated for 12 seconds following transition to weight off wheels. During that time,
the FCCs will use a fixed AOA gain for fly away and the flap state will remain in FULL flaps
irrespective of FLAP switch position. If the Left versus Right failure persists, the AOA X-out condition
will occur along with an FCS caution. Even if the AOA X-out does not occur, it is recommended that
the AOA Four Channel Failure corrective action procedure is used for landing after the mission is
complete.
15.19.4 DUAL AOA FAILURE ON TAKEOFF. With FCC OFP 18E-102 and subsequent, there is added
protection provided to counter the unlikely event of a dual AOA failure (both probes binding) on
takeoff. The FCC software monitors the AOA probe values during takeoff to ensure that they are
moving properly. There are two monitors active on takeoff. The first monitor simply looks for both
AOA probes to be in the range of -6° to 10° as the aircraft accelerates through 100 to 112 KCAS, with
WonW and weight on the nosewheel. If both probes are outside this range for longer than 0.125
seconds, AOA special logic (fixed gains) is engaged. After transitioning to weight off wheels, there is an
additional monitor that compares the average corrected AOA values from the probes to an estimated
AOA value derived from pitch and flightpath angles. If average corrected AOA value from the probes
differs by 6° or more from the estimated AOA value within the first 8 seconds after takeoff, the AOA
special logic is engaged. The AOA special logic provides the control system a fixed AOA gain for a
nominal takeoff. Aircraft takeoff-characteristics are nominal, with a slight nose−down tendency. The
special logic is annunciated to the pilot in the form of an AOA caution which is set for a period of 12
seconds after the transition to weight off wheels. During the 12 second period the flaps are commanded
to FULL regardless of the FLAP switch position. At the end of the 12 seconds the flaps will move to
a position coincident with the FLAP switch position, and a FCS caution is set along with a four-channel
AOA X-out. This four-channel AOA X-out condition can not be reset in flight. Execute the AOA Four
Channel Failure corrective action procedure.
15.20 AILERON HINGE FAILURE - SUSPECTED, INBOARD.
Inboard aileron hinge failure may be suspected if a sudden uncommanded roll-off appears with no
corresponding aural
″Flight Controls, Flight Controls
″ alert or associated FCS Xs or BLIN codes. If the
hinge has failed, the affected aileron will not respond normally to commanded inputs. However, the
aileron position indicator on the FCS page will function normally since the affected aileron actuator is
operating properly. In this case, the aileron position indicator on the FCS page will be indicating the
position of the actuator rod and not the aileron surface. The only true indication of this failure is a
visual check of the suspected aileron to determine if it is responding to control inputs.
For a failed hinge condition, the resultant flying qualities will be degraded but adequate for a shorebased landing. Aircraft response to normal control inputs will be fairly uncoordinated and roll
performance away from the damaged aileron will be reduced. A failed inboard hinge may result in a
condition where wing and aileron oscillations occur, immediately reduce airspeed by decelerating at 1g
without using speedbrake until the oscillations subside.
NOTE
Do not use speedbrake to reduce airspeed. Ailerons contribute to the
integrated speedbrake function and selecting speedbrake with a
damaged aileron may cause roll transients.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-15-47 ORIGINAL
If ship based, divert to an appropriate airfield. When determining the divert/BINGO profile,
consider the presence of wing or aileron oscillations and their impact on divert airspeed and fuel
management.
The presence of wing or aileron oscillations and the need to slow down
until the oscillations subside may significantly impact the planned
divert/BINGO profile.
Prior to landing, conduct a controllability check. During the controllability check, avoid selecting
flaps - HALF or FULL. Selecting flaps - HALF or FULL will cause significant roll-off into the failed
aileron. Because a hinge failure is undetected by the FCS, normal operation is assumed and aileron
droop will be commanded when flaps HALF or FULL is selected. The damaged aileron is likely to
remain undrooped and result in significant roll-off due to asymmetric aileron droop. For this case, large
stick deflections are required to maintain wings level and significant trim inputs are necessary to
reduce stick forces. Placing the flaps in HALF or FULL may also result in control surface binding if
the damaged aileron interferes with the deflection of the trailing edge flaps (TEF).
Lateral weight asymmetries will aggravate the roll-off and may preclude the aircrew’s ability to zero
the roll-off with trim. Consideration should be given to jettisoning stores to reduce lateral weight
asymmetries and to reduce gross weight for landing.
Execute a FLAPS-AUTO, straight-in approach (on-speed AOA, if controllable) to landing. Trim as
required to reduce lateral stick forces. Crosscheck aircraft groundspeed to ensure that it is below safe
tire speed limits and the maximum engagement speed for the arresting gear. If controllability is not in
question, fuel may be dumped to reduce airspeed. However, controllability checks should be completed
at the new (lighter) weight. The aircraft should then be re-trimmed on-speed for wings level and
balanced (ball centered) flight. As the aircraft slows, it will require more directional trim to center the
ball. Flying qualities should be adequate for a normal shore-based FLAPS-AUTO approach to landing.
Handling characteristics may be degraded such that aircraft response to control stick or throttle inputs
may be coupled in roll, pitch, and yaw. These transient aircraft motions may be annoying, but do not
significantly degrade glideslope and line-up capture.
15.20.1 Suspected Inboard Aileron Hinge Failure Corrective Action.
If failed inboard aileron hinge suspected -
1. Reduce load factor to 1g.
2. Oppose roll-off with lateral stick, rudder or trim.
If aileron or wing oscillations are present -
3. Airspeed - IMMEDIATELY REDUCE UNTIL OSCILLATIONS SUBSIDE.
DO NOT USE SPEEDBRAKE TO REDUCE AIRSPEED.
If aileron or wing oscillations are present, failure to immediately reduce
airspeed until oscillations cease can result in further structural failure.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-15-48 ORIGINAL
If no aileron or wing oscillations are present -
3. Airspeed - MAINTAIN AS PRACTICAL
NOTE
Use of speedbrake with a damaged aileron will cause an immediate roll
transient and should be avoided.
4. Use smooth, small control inputs.
5. Land as soon as practical.
If ship based -
6. DIVERT
Bingo profile may be adversely affected due to reduced airspeed necessary for given condition. Allow for a controllability check prior to landing.
For shore-based landing -
7. Perform controllability check with FLAPS AUTO at safe altitude. Trim as required.
8. Verify aircraft groundspeed is less than nose tire and arresting gear groundspeed limits.
9. Execute a straight-in approach with FLAPS AUTO.
10. Make a short field arrestment if situation permits.

CHAPTER 16
Landing Emergencies
16.1 SINGLE ENGINE FAILURE IN LANDING CONFIGURATION
At MIL power and below, the amount of yaw/roll caused by a single engine failure is minimal, and
the aircraft is easily controllable. If an engine fails with both throttles at MAX power (e.g., waveoff),
a significant amount of yaw/roll can be anticipated due to asymmetric thrust. In this case, timely
rudder pedal inputs (up to FULL) are required. Too much rudder pedal is not harmful, but too little
rudder pedal may cause controllability problems. Therefore, FULL rudder pedal to oppose yaw/roll is
prudent. If lateral stick is also required to oppose roll (worst case), inputs should be limited to
approximately ½ displacement. Lateral stick inputs greater than ½ throw may compromise directional controllability and result in excessive sideslip buildup. The demand on the rudders may be too
great when trying to balance asymmetric thrust and coordinate the adverse yaw generated by the
ailerons when opposing the tendency of the aircraft to roll into the failed engine. If the rudders are
saturated (surfaces against the stops) and additional adverse yawing moment is generated, sideslip
grows and an adverse yaw departure will result. During single engine operations, restricting lateral
stick inputs to less than ½ throw reduces the potential for an adverse yaw departure.
*1. Throttles - MIL or MAX
*2. FLAP switch - HALF
*3. Maintain on-speed AOA and balanced flight.
When single engine with the operating engine at MAX, the possibility of
an adverse yaw departure increases as AOA exceeds on-speed.
4. Refer to Single Engine Approach and Landing.
16.2 SINGLE ENGINE APPROACH AND LANDING
During a single engine approach and landing, use of the afterburner on the operating engine is not
restricted as long as on-speed AOA is maintained.
When single engine with the operating engine at MAX, the possibility of
an adverse yaw departure increases as AOA exceeds on-speed.
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS -
1. Reduce gross weight (44,000 lb max, lower if practical).
2. Maintain operating engine above 80% RPM during flap and landing gear extension.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-16-1 ORIGINAL
3. Consider crossbleed to provide HYD 2 pressure to extend the landing gear normally and to
preserve APU accumulator pressure for emergency braking and emergency nosewheel steering.
• Do not crossbleed if engine and/or AMAD related damage is suspected.
• Extended crossbleeding of a failed engine traps feed tank fuel on that
side if the FIRE light has not been pushed, and may result in a
flameout.
• ATS exhaust may blister paint and cause possible door damage on the
aft underside of the fuselage.
• Starting the APU airborne may result in a BALD shutdown due to
ingestion of exhaust gases into the APU ducting.
4. Fly a straight-in approach.
5. Plan approach to make turns using shallow bank angle (≤15°)
6. Do not exceed on-speed AOA in turns.
7. Avoid turns into inoperative engine.

9. Do not taxi (even if HYD 2A caution is removed).
16.3 SINGLE ENGINE WAVEOFF/BOLTER
During a single engine waveoff or bolter, use of the afterburner on the operating engine is not
restricted as long as on-speed AOA is maintained. Best single engine rate of climb occurs at or near
on-speed AOA regardless of configuration, lateral weight asymmetry, or gross weight. If MAX power
is used, pilot workload is higher due to higher asymmetric thrust effects. Up to full rudder pedal may
be required to oppose yaw/roll. If required, coordinated lateral stick should be used to maintain wings
level.
1. Throttles - MIL (MAX if required)
2. Maintain on-speed AOA and balanced flight.

With LDG GEAR handle DN or UP (DN preferred) -
6. LDG GEAR handle - ROTATE 90° CLOCKWISE then PULL TO DETENT
7. Verify three down and locked.
8. Make a short field arrestment (if practical)
NOTE
If the landing gear was emergency extended with the LDG GEAR
handle in the UP position, the landing gear warning light remains on
with the gear down and locked.
9. EMERG BRK handle - PULL TO DETENT (Anti-skid is not available)
If the forward pressure reducer valve is failed, normal gear extension and
normal braking will be inoperative. If emergency gear extension was
required to achieve three down and locked with a good HYD 2A system,
emergency brakes should be selected prior to landing. If the landing gear
was emergency extended with a good HYD 2A system, emergency brakes
should be selected, as failure of normal braking is anticipated.
If HYD 2B is operative -

16.7 PLANING LINK FAILURE
With the landing gear down and locked, a planing link failure is indicated by a flashing LEFT or
RIGHT landing gear position light, illumination of the landing gear warning light, and annunciation
of the landing gear warning tone.
• A planing link failure may cause a sudden swerve on touchdown in the
direction of the failed gear.
• Planing link failure may not be annunciated until after touchdown,
providing the pilot with little to no reaction time between initial
annunciation and a violent yaw/swerve. If flyaway airspeed is available, pilots should be prepared to make the decision to execute the Go
Around procedure immediately at initial planing link failure annunciation.
Planing link failure indications that are momentary or disappear after
initial activation may be indicative of an actual planing link failure.
If detected after touchdown and flyaway airspeed available -
*1. Go Around
If flyaway airspeed not available -
*1. Select emergency brakes (if appropriate).
*2. HOOK handle - DOWN (if required)
If detected airborne, or following go around -
1. LDG GEAR handle - DO NOT CYCLE
2. ANTI SKID switch - OFF
If arresting gear available -
3. Make a fly-in short field arrestment with LSO assistance (if available).
If arresting gear not available -
3. Make a minimum sink rate landing.
4. Consider touchdown on good gear side of runway.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-16-12 ORIGINAL
5. Avoid braking until as slow as practical or until needed to prevent loss of directional control.
6. Brake using the good gear and maintain directional control with NWS.
7. Use symmetrical braking only if necessary to avoid departing the runway.
• Use of symmetrical wheel brakes with a planing link failure may cause
a sudden swerve in the direction of the failed gear.
• The ability to maintain directional control with braking on the
appropriate side, NWS, and rudder will rapidly decrease as the aircraft
decelerates on rollout.
• Lateral asymmetry on the failed side may aggravate severity of
yaw/swerve in the direction of failed gear.
8. Do not taxi once stopped.
16.8 ARRESTMENT - FIELD
Maximum engaging speeds, gross weights, and off-center distances are listed in the Field Arresting
Gear Data charts, figure 16-5.
16.8.1 Arresting Gear Types. Field arresting gear includes anchor chain, water squeezer, and Morest
types. All types require arresting hook engagement with a crossdeck pendant cable rigged across the
runway. Arresting gear location varies as follows:
• SHORT FIELD - Located 1,500 to 2,000 feet past the approach end of the runway. May require
a request and slight delay to rig.
• MIDFIELD - Located near the halfway point of the runway. May require a request to rig for the
desired direction.
• LONG FIELD or ABORT - Located 1,500 to 2,000 feet short of the departure end of the runway.
Usually rigged for immediate use.
• OVERRUN - Located shortly past the departure end of runway. Usually rigged for immediate
use.
A field may have none, all, or any combination of these arresting gear types. Knowing the type,
location, and compatibility with the aircraft of the installed gear is mandatory. Knowing the local
policy for rigging installed gear is also required.
Wrong direction engagement of chain-type arresting gear can severely
damage the aircraft.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-16-13 ORIGINAL
16.8.2 Arrestment Decision. The decision to take an arrested landing is dependent on the emergency
situation. In an emergency, use all available means to determine the status of the aircraft (instruments,
other aircraft, LSO, RDO, tower or other ground personnel). Typically, emergencies related to the loss
of the utility hydraulic system (e.g., loss of normal brakes and NWS), or to questionable braking, or
directional control (e.g., planing link failure, blown tire, or brake problem) dictate making an arrested
landing. If in doubt, a precautionary arrested landing is always prudent. If fuel is streaming, a field
arrested landing is not recommended due to the high probability that sparks and heat from the hook
may ignite the fuel.
Once the decision to arrest has been made, determine the best available arresting gear type and
location. Notify the control tower as far in advance as possible and give estimated time to landing in
minutes. Unrigged gear may require 10 to 20 minutes to rig. If winds are light and the emergency
situation dictates, the tower may request an arrested landing on an off-duty runway to retain the
capability to launch and recover other aircraft. If unfamiliar with arresting gear location, consider
making a practice pass.
Engage arresting gear on runway centerline, in the three-point attitude, as slow as practical, and with
feet off the brakes until engagement. After arrestment, common sense and conditions determine
whether to keep engines running or to shut down the engines and evacuate the aircraft.
16.8.3 Arrestment - Short Field. Make a short field arrested landing for anticipated directional
control or brake problems or if minimum rollout is desired. If available, request LSO assistance. The
LSO should have radio communications and be stationed near the touchdown point.
Inform the LSO of the intended touchdown point, if other than immediately before the gear. Lower
the hook before starting the approach and, if possible, get a positive hook down check.
Determine maximum engagement speed at the expected landing gross weight (see figure 16-5). Final
approach speed depends on flap setting and the specific emergency. If required, adjust gross weight to
minimize approach speed. A constant glideslope approach to touchdown is allowed (mirror or fresnel
lens if available). Plan the approach to touchdown on centerline at or just before the arresting wire. If
the required approach speed is in excess of maximum engaging speed, land short, select IDLE power,
and decelerate into the gear. Be prepared for nose gear tire failure above 195 KGS or main gear tire
failure above 210 KGS. Plan for a long field arrestment, if maximum short field engaging speed cannot
be met. If landing at or below maximum engaging speed, maintain approach power until arrestment is
assured. After engagement, retard the throttles to IDLE. Use moderate braking, if available, during
deceleration to prevent aircraft from two-blocking the arresting gear at higher engagement speeds or
gross weights. Secure engines and evacuate the aircraft, if required. If the wire is missed, waveoff
immediately.
16.8.4 Arrestment - Long Field. Make a long field arrestment when there is a stopping problem (e.g.,
aborted takeoff or loss of brakes with no loss of directional control, etc.). If possible, go around and
make a short field arrestment. Lower the hook in time for it to fully extend before engagement
(normally 1,000 feet prior to the arresting gear). Line up on runway centerline. If possible, inform the
control tower of intention to engage the long field gear, so that aircraft landing behind can be waved
off. Do not delay a decision to go around based solely on the availability of long field gear.
16.9 BARRICADE ARRESTMENT
If a barricade arrestment is required, the LSOs will give a detailed briefing of barricade procedures.
1. Burn down or dump fuel as required to obtain the lowest gross weight feasible.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-16-14 ORIGINAL
2. External ordnance - JETTISON
3. External fuel tanks - JETTISON EXCEPT AS NOTED IN LANDING GEAR MALFUNCTION
- LANDING GUIDE - CARRIER LANDING
NOTE
Barricade engagement with installed AIM-7, AIM-120 and/or AIM-9
missiles is not recommended. AIM-7 and AIM-120 missiles may
separate and AIM-9 missiles will probably separate from the aircraft.
Inability to jettison/fire these missiles does not preclude successful
barricade engagement. Barricade may be engaged with empty external
tanks if tanks cannot be jettisoned. When live ordnance cannot be
jettisoned, barricade engagement should only be attempted with all
landing gear down.
4. Fly an on-speed, on-glideslope, on-centerline approach with zero drift all the way to touchdown.
When ″Cut-Cut″ called by LSOs -
5. Throttles - OFF
When aircraft motion ceases -
6. Egress.

(3) Data provided in aborted takeoff column may be used for emergency high gross weight arrestment.
(4) Standard BAK-12 limits are based on 150 foot span, 1 inch cross deck pendant, 40,000 pound weight setting,
and 950 foot runout. No information available regarding applicability to other configurations. BAK-12
engaging speed limit is 96 knots at 59,000 pounds. Due to runout limitations, it is recommended this gear not
be engaged at weights greater than 59,000 pounds.
(5) Dual BAK-12 limits are based on 150 to 300 foot span, 1-1/4 inch cross deck pendant, 50,000 pound weight
setting, and 1,200 foot runout. No information available regarding applicability to other configurations.
For E-28 or BAK-13 arresting gear systems, two-blocking can occur at
aircraft weights above 50,000 pounds and at engaging speeds above 130
knots. Moderate braking should be utilized during deceleration, if available, to aid in stopping the forward motion of the aircraft and prevent an
aircraft with idle power from slowly pulling the gear to a two-block
position. If a two-block occurs and aircraft travel reverses, engine thrust
should be applied judiciously to minimize aircraft walkback. Brakes, if
available, should not be utilized during aircraft walkback, as they may
induce the aircraft to tip back onto the exhaust nozzles.

NOTE
• Maximum engaging speed for E-5 chain gear is limited by arresting gear capacity.
• Off center engagement into an E-5 system must not exceed 25% of the runway span.
• Before making an E-5 arrestment, confirm the type and chain length of installed gear (tower or
FLIP IFR Supplement) to ensure the corresponding maximum engaging speed is not exceeded.

NOTES:
1. Aircraft will be flying a half flap straight-in. Approach speed will be higher, therefore wind over deck requirements will increase. Consult applicable ARB
for details. Possibility of malfunction affecting other engine. Make sure all possible effort is made to recover aircraft immediately.
2. Aircraft may require a tow out of the landing area.
3. Immediate tanking required if any delay in recovery exists.
4. Pilot will be unable to fold wings upon landing.
5. For HYD 2A or Dual T/R failure, landing gear will be emergency extended and aircraft will be committed to a dirty bingo if unable to recover. Consider
bingo options before extending landing gear.
6. Problem could be symptomatic of a fuel leak. If so, immediate recovery is required.
7. Approximately 4,400 pounds of fuel will be available in the engine feed tanks.
8. If battery gauge reads 24 volts (LOT 22 and up), or BATT SW caution light on (LOT 21), the essential bus is being powered by the aircraft battery and 5
to 10 minutes of flight remains.
9. Aircraft will be flying straight-in approach. If half-flap approach required, approach speed will be higher. Consult applicable ARB for WOD requirements.
10. Aircraft will be flying 10° AOA full or half flap straight-in approach. Approach speed will be higher; therefore, wind over deck requirements will increase.
Recovery WOD should be kept as close as possible to ARB recommendations.
11. Unable to transfer external fuel. Consider divert or jettison of external tanks.
12. Decision for Pull Fwd or Next Avail recovery determined by nature of damage sustained during birdstrike. Refer to appropriate emergency on recovery

CHAPTER 17
Ejection
17.1 EJECTION
The ejection seat must be used to escape from the aircraft in flight. If the canopy fails to jettison
during the ejection sequence, the seat will eject through the canopy.
17.1.1 Ejection Seat Restrictions. During ejection seat development and testing, the SJU-17(V) 1/A,
2/A, and 9/A NACES seats were qualified for use by aviators with nude weights from 136 to 213
pounds, while the SJU-17A (V)1/A, 2/A, and 9/A NACES seats were qualified for use by aviators with
nude body weights from 136 to 245 pounds. The minimum and maximum nude body weights allowed
by OPNAVINST 3710.7 Series for those on aviation duty are 100 pounds and 235 pounds, respectively.
Therefore, a gap exists between the ejection seat certified weight range and the weights of the current
aviator population.
• Operation of the ejection seat by personnel weighing less than the
qualified minimum nude weight, or more than the maximum qualified
weight (noted above), subjects the occupant to increased risk of injury.
• An increased risk of severe injury or death during parachute landing fall
(PLF) exists with surface winds exceeding 25 knots. High surface winds
contribute directly to total landing velocity. When time permits, select
parachute steering and turn into the wind to reduce landing velocity.
• Pilots should be trained in additional ejection risks associated with
JHMCS. Ejection with JHMCS may cause severe or fatal injury.
The ejection seat catapult was designed for the qualified weight range only. Ejection seat stability
is directly related to occupant restraint. All occupants should be properly restrained in the seat by the
torso harness for optimum performance and minimum injury risk. Inertial reel performance may be
degraded for occupants outside of the certified weight range
17.1.1.1 Injury Risks - Nude Weight Less than 136 Pounds. Lighter weight occupants are subject to
a higher risk of injury due to the following factors:
1. Excessive pull back during inertial reel retraction.
2. Poor positioning during ejection.
3. Greater acceleration during catapult firing.
4. Higher parachute opening shock during ejections near the upper end of Mode 1 (approaching 300
KCAS).
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-17-1 ORIGINAL
5. Seat instability during drogue deployment during ejections above 300 KCAS.
Lighter weight aircrew have greater risk of neck injury during ejection
while using the JHMCS configuration. Minimum nude aircrew weights
authorized to fly with the JHMCS helmet system is 136 pounds. Aircrew
weighing less than the authorized minimum nude weight are restricted
from flying with the JHMCS helmet system.
17.1.1.2 Injury Risks - Nude Weight Greater than 213 Pounds (245 Pounds for SJU-17A). Heavier
weight occupants are subject to a higher risk of injury due to the following factors:
1. Poor positioning during ejection due to insufficient pull back during inertial reel retraction.
2. Insufficient altitude to clear the aircraft tail structure.
3. Insufficient altitude for full parachute inflation in zero/zero cases or at extremely low altitude/
airspeed.
4. Higher descent rates during parachute landing.
17.1.1.3 Airspeed during Ejection. Ejection analysis shows:
1. Optimum speed for ejection is 250 KCAS and below.
2. Between 250 and 600 KCAS, appreciable forces are exerted on the body, making ejection more
hazardous.
3. Above 600 KCAS, excessive forces are exerted on the body making ejection extremely hazardous.
When possible, slow the aircraft before ejection to reduce the forces on the body.
Never actuate the manual override handle in flight, as ejection would then be impossible and the
aircrew would be unrestrained during landing. When the manual override handle is actuated, the
ejection seat SAFE/ARMED handle is rotated to the SAFE position, the aircrew is released from the
seat, and the harness cannot be reconnected.
If the seat becomes unlocked and slides partially up the rails, ejection
and/or parachute deployment is still possible but the ejection handle
must be pulled, followed by activation of the manual override handle.
Under these circumstances, low altitude ejection capabilities are compromised.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-17-2 ORIGINAL
Whenever possible, ejection airspeed should be limited to a maximum of 400 KCAS when flying with
the JHMCS helmet system.
The JHMCS configuration can contribute to increased neck loads during
ejection, particularly at moderate to high speeds. Generally, neck loads
increase as ejection airspeed increases and may cause severe or fatal
injury. Aircrews should eject at the lowest possible airspeed to minimize
neck and injury loads.
NOTE
Aircrew will brief system peculiarities and potential injury from out of
position and high speed ejections prior to each flight when using
A/A24A-56 JHMCS lightweight HGU-55 A/P helmet.
17.1.2 Low Altitude Ejection. The minimum altitude required for a successful ejection is dependent
on sink rate, airspeed and bank angle, and airspeed and dive angle. The effects of sink rate are shown
in figure 17-1. The effects of airspeed and bank angle are shown in figure 17-2. The effects of airspeed
and dive angle are shown in figure 17-3.
The decision to eject at low altitude must be based on these factors to ensure a successful ejection.
Additionally, ejection seat trajectory is improved if the aircraft is zoomed to a higher altitude prior to
ejection initiation. The additional altitude increases time available for seat separation and parachute
deployment. However, do not delay the decision to eject if the aircraft is nose down and cannot be
leveled.
With wings level and no sink rate, ejection is feasible within the following parameters:
1. Ground level - zero airspeed.
2. Surface to 50,000 feet MSL - 600 KCAS maximum.
Ejection at low altitude allows only a matter of seconds to prepare for landing. Over water, inflation
of the LPU is the most important step to be accomplished. Release of the parachute quick-release
fittings as the feet contact the water is the second most important step to prevent entanglement in the
parachute shroud lines.
When ejection is in the immediate vicinity of the carrier, parachute entanglement combined with
wake and associated turbulence can rapidly pull a survivor under. The deployed seat survival kit may
contribute to shroud line entanglement. Be prepared to cut shroud lines if the parachute is dragging
the survivor.
The crashed aircraft may release large quantities of jet fuel and fumes which could hamper breathing
and/or create a fire hazard. If jet fuel is present, do not use a flare marker. The emergency oxygen
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
V-17-3 ORIGINAL
system may be invaluable in this case. If emergency oxygen is required, do not discard the survival kit,
as this terminates the availability of emergency oxygen. However, totally discarding the survival kit
may be appropriate after considering weather, sea conditions, and rescue potential.
Low altitude ejection may result in parachute canopy disintegration due
to the aircraft impact fireball.
The variety and complexity of conditions encountered during the “time critical” actions following a
low altitude, overwater ejection make it impossible to formulate procedures to cover every contingency.
17.1.3 High Altitude Ejection. The basic low altitude procedure is applicable to high altitude
ejection. The zoom is useful to slow the aircraft to a safer ejection speed or to provide more time and
glide distance if immediate ejection is not necessary. If the aircraft is descending out of control, eject
by 6,000 feet AGL. Even if under control, do not delay ejection below 2,000 feet AGL. Head the aircraft
toward an unpopulated area, if possible.
17.1.4 Ejection Procedures. See figure 17-4.
17.2 DITCHING
In the event ejection has failed and the aircraft must be ditched, see figure 17-5.
17.3 SEAWATER ENTRY
If downed in seawater, SEAWARS releases the parachute canopy within 2 seconds. However, if able,
manually unlock each canopy release immediately on seawater entry. The SEAWARS does not operate
in freshwater.

EJECTION INJURIES AND BODY POSITIONING
THESE PROPER BODY POSITIONS
MUST BE TAKEN TO PREVENT INJURIES
1. Press head firmly against headrest.
2. Elevate chin slightly (10°).
3. Press shoulders and back firmly against seat.
4. Hold elbows and arms firmly towards sides.
5. Press buttocks firmly against the seat back.
6. Place thighs flat against seat.
7. Press outside of thighs against side of seat.
8. Place heels firmly on deck, toes on rudder pedals.
If ejection occurs without QDC properly stowed in QMB, death will
probably result from neck injury.
EJECTION INITIATION
There are two acceptable methods for ejection initiation; the two-hand grip and the
single-hand grip.
Two-hand method -
1. Grip the ejection handle with the thumb and at least two fingers of each hand, palms
toward body.
Keep elbows close to body.
Single-hand method -
1. Grip handle with the strong hand, palm toward body. Grip wrist of strong hand with
other hand, palm toward body. Keep elbows close to body.
Both methods -
2. Pull handle sharply up and toward abdomen, keeping elbows in. Ensure handle
pulled to end of travel. Continue holding handle until seat/man separation.
NOTE
In low altitude situations, a one-handed method, using one hand to initiate
ejection and the other to maintain the aircraft in the safe operating envelope of
the ejection seat, may be required. If firing the seat by this method, particular
attention must be paid to maintaining proper body position.

If the cockpit has flooded, the LPU may have inflated due to the FLU-8 water
activated automatic inflation device. If so, care must be taken during exit to avoid
catching the lobes causing entanglement or LPU damage.
5. Abandon aircraft.
6. If the LPU has not automatically inflated - INFLATE
7. Deploy survival kit and inflate life raft.
Should aircraft be abandoned under water, exhale while ascending to the surface to
prevent bursting of lungs due to pressure differential between lungs and outside of
body.

CHAPTER 19
Instrument Flight
19.1 INSTRUMENT FLIGHT
19.1.1 Before Takeoff. If instrument flight is expected immediately following takeoff or flight in
RVSM airspace is planned, thoroughly check navigation equipment and crosscheck the HUD and
standby flight instruments. Check to ensure the HUD altitude is within 30 feet of parking spot
elevation, and the standby altimeter is within 60 feet of parking spot elevation. If flight in icing
conditions is anticipated, perform an engine anti-ice detector test (ENG ANTI ICE switch to TEST).
If icing conditions are anticipated immediately after takeoff, place the ENG and PITOT ANTI ICE
switches to ON just prior to takeoff roll.
19.1.2 Inflight. In RVSM controlled airspace, BALT autopilot mode must be engaged when level at
an assigned altitude on the HUD below Mach 0.90. This is required in order to fully comply with
RVSM requirements. After engagement, the Mach limit is Mach 0.92.
During instrument flight, particularly in icing conditions, and for flight in RVSM airspace,
frequently crosscheck standby flight instruments to verify that the primary systems are functioning
normally. A slowly flashing velocity vector indicates that the INS is providing valid attitude
information but the FCC air data functions are the source for the velocity vector.
The HUD altitude and standby altimeter readings will differ as a function of Mach number. In
RVSM controlled airspace, when at assigned altitude on HUD, periodically add standby altimeter
error (Standby Altimeter Error table below) to standby altimeter and compare to HUD altitude. If
altitudes differ by more than 250 feet, notify ATC that the aircraft is no longer RVSM compliant. With
MC OFP H5E AND UP, use the HSI/DATA/(A/C) page STBY CHK value to compare directly with
the standby altimeter. Both are uncorrected altitudes.
NOTE
The barometric setting is assumed to be 29.92 for all RVSM related
activities. Do not use the standby altimeter for RVSM altitude holding
requirements.
Standby Altimeter Error
Mach Number Standby Altimeter Error (Feet)
0.50 120
0.60 150
0.65 175
0.70 200
0.75 220
0.80 280
0.85 260
0.90 330
0.92 380
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VI-19-1 ORIGINAL
In RVSM controlled airspace, compare left and right AOA values immediately after establishing
assigned altitude on HUD. If L and R AOA values on the FCS page differ by more than 2 degrees,
notify ATC that the aircraft is no longer RVSM compliant. Allow time for the probes to settle if in
turbulent air.
19.1.3 Approaches.
19.1.3.1 Descent. If fuel conservation is of concern, an enroute descent should be flown at 250 KCAS
and IDLE power. Advancing the throttles slightly to ‘‘pucker’’ the nozzles reduces drag and results in
a slightly more efficient descent.
19.1.3.2 Holding. Fly the holding pattern as directed/depicted. For maximum endurance, maintain
approximately 225 to 250 KCAS between 15,000 and 25,000 feet MSL. Total fuel flow should be
approximately 4,000 pph.
19.1.3.3 AN/APG-79 AESA Considerations. Aircrew operating AN/APG-79 AESA equipped aircraft
shall be aware that directing AN/APG-79 AESA transmissions toward airfields may cause strong
electromagnetic interference (EMI) affecting the safety of aircraft on approach. Unless specifically
authorized for operational necessity or required for safety of flight, aircrew shall cease AN/APG-79
AESA radar transmissions whenever operating within 10 nm of civilian airfields. Reference Chapter 4.4
for AN/APG-79 AESA radar limitations.
19.1.3.4 Non-Precision. The navigation aids available provide excellent position keeping capability
with multiple redundancy and steering cues. INS offset data can be used to provide accurate steering
to a TACAN IAF and the CRS select option can be used to obtain a visual reference on the MPCD and
to provide steering cues on the HUD.
Penetration should be flown at 250 KCAS and approximately 75% N2 rpm with the speedbrake as
required to control descent rate. Dirty up at 10 nm from touchdown.
19.1.3.5 Precision Approaches. The downwind leg should be flown at 230 to 250 KCAS with gear UP
and flaps AUTO. Transition to the landing configuration when directed or no later than 6 nmi from
touchdown. To begin descent, lower the velocity vector to approximately -3° and maintain onspeed
AOA. Small changes in velocity vector placement can be used to control glideslope. Set the RALT at
decision height and be prepared for missed approach.
19.2 DEGRADED SYSTEMS
If the INS fails, the ATT switch should be placed to STBY.

CHAPTER 20
Extreme Weather Procedures
20.1 ICE AND RAIN
Before flight, check with the weather service for the location of the freezing level and probable icing
conditions. Flight through known or suspected icing conditions should be avoided, if possible, to
prevent engine FOD from ice ingestion.
Prolonged flight in icing conditions is an emergency situation. Flight duration which allows a
noticeable accumulation of ice (more than 3/8 inch) on the LEFs constitutes prolonged flight. Ice forms
rapidly on the inlet lip and, if allowed to accumulate, can be drawn into the engine causing compressor
stalls and/or major FOD. Severe icing conditions can result in rapid ice accumulation in a very short
time. An INLET ICE caution should serve as a warning to take action to avoid further ice
accumulation.
If icing is anticipated or encountered -
1. Perform an engine anti-ice detector test (ENG ANTI ICE - TEST) to verify proper detector
operation.
20.1.1 Ground Operation.
If ambient temperature between 0 and 7°C -
1. Minimize engine operation above IDLE to reduce the potential for ice accumulation on the engine
inlet lips. Inlet lip icing can occur at these conditions without the INLET ICE caution.
If visible moisture exists (rain, fog) and the temperature is 45°F (7°C) or less -
1. ENG ANTI ICE switch - ON (after engine start)
2. PITOT ANTI ICE switch - ON (after taxi but prior to takeoff)
If an INLET ICE caution appears prior to takeoff -
1. Do not takeoff. Return to the line and have the engines inspected for possible FOD.
20.1.2 In Flight.
If icing is anticipated or encountered -
1. Enter the clouds at the last possible moment. If on top, descend rapidly.
2. ENG ANTI ICE switch – ON
3. PITOT ANTI ICE switch – ON
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VI-20-1 ORIGINAL
If no ice is visible on the LEFs -
4. Airspeed - Increase until INLET TEMP is at least +5°C (+10°C preferred) on ENG format (if
possible).
5. Climb or descend out of icing danger zone (figure 20-1).
Monitor INLET TEMP and Mach. If time and fuel permit, climb to a safe altitude. Altitudes
above about 25,000 feet or ambient temperatures below -30°C generally prevent ice formation
since the water droplets are frozen and do not adhere. Descend only if sure that ambient
temperature is well above freezing at a safe altitude below.
When clear of icing conditions -
6. ENG ANTI ICE switch - OFF
If ice is visible on the LEFs -
4. Throttles - Reduce below 80% N2 rpm (if possible). Avoid throttle transients above 90% N2 rpm.
5. Airspeed - Maintain above 250 KCAS.
6. AOA - Maintain less than 6° (if possible) to prevent ice accumulation on underside of LEX.
7. Avoid abrupt maneuvers and bank angles over 20°.
8. Descend rapidly below the freezing level.
Figure 20-1. Icing Danger Zone
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VI-20-2 ORIGINAL
For landing -
9. WINDSHIELD switch - ANTI ICE or RAIN (as required)
The ANTI-ICE position should be used as required to clear the windshield of ice and/or visible
moisture.
Do not operate the windshield anti-ice/rain removal system on a dry
windshield. If a WDSHLD HOT caution appears, place the WINDSHIELD switch to OFF immediately to prevent heat damage to the
windshield.
10. Reduce airspeed and lower the landing gear at the last possible moment (minimizes ice
accumulation on the gear).
If a missed approach is necessary -
11. Slowly advance throttles to the minimum power required for a safe waveoff.
12. Raise landing gear and flaps as soon as possible.
Post-flight -
13. Report all icing encounters (INLET ICE caution) on VID MAF to ensure the engine is inspected
for FOD before the next flight.
20.1.3 Landing in Heavy Rain. Refer to the Wet Runway Landings section in chapter 7.
If landing in heavy rain -
1. WINDSHIELD switch - RAIN
Do not operate the windshield anti-ice/rain removal system on a dry
windshield. If a WDSHLD HOT caution appears, place the WINDSHIELD switch to OFF immediately after landing to prevent heat
damage to the windshield.
For wet (standing water) runway conditions -
2. Reduce gross weight to minimum practical.
3. ANTI-SKID switch - VERIFY ON (shore based)
4. Land onspeed or slightly slow with the power reduced to IDLE as soon as possible.
If directional control is comfortable after touchdown -
5. Use maximum anti-skid braking to minimize landing distance.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VI-20-3 ORIGINAL
If directional control problems occur -
6. Do not hesitate to add power and go around.
7. Make arrested landing, if possible.
20.2 TURBULENT AIR AND THUNDERSTORM OPERATION
Avoid flight through thunderstorms and microbursts. If penetration is unavoidable, fly at optimum
cruise airspeed but not less than 250 KCAS if above 35,000 feet MSL.
The radar MAP mode can be used to detect storm cells.
1. SURF MAP mode - SELECT (NAV or A/G)
2. RANGE SCALE - SELECT (AS DESIRED)
3. ANTENNA ELEVATION - Raise to horizon. Make sure the radar antenna is raised sufficiently
to preclude radar returns from the ground. The RDR ATTK format should display areas of
precipitation. If possible, deviate flightpath to avoid these areas.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VI-20-4 ORIGINAL
CHAPTER 21
Hot Weather Procedures
21.1 GENERAL
On the ground, the avionics ground cooling fan should provide adequate avionics cooling up to an
ambient temperature of approximately 103°F. Inflight, the ECS controller should provide adequate
avionics cooling at all conditions.
With outside air temperature greater than 103°F, fuel recirculation through the heat exchangers
during ground operations may be insufficient at IDLE RPM to keep engine and AMAD oil temperature
within limits. Increasing the affected engine rpm increases circulation and should clear an OIL HOT
caution within 20 seconds (normal operating system).
Under adverse conditions (i.e. hot, heavy, and forward CG), takeoff speeds may be significantly
higher than those seen at nominal conditions. Knowing the aircraft predicted takeoff performance
should prevent a high speed abort in what is a normally functioning aircraft.
21.2 GROUND OPERATIONS
If OAT is approaching or is above 103°F -
1. Non-essential avionics equipment (radar, TCN, IFF, etc.) ON and BIT then OFF (if required)
2. Consider increasing one engine at or above 74% N2 rpm (if possible)
3. ENG format - Monitor ENG OIL TEMP (149°C) and AMAD OIL TEMP (88°C)
4. Avionics equipment - ON JUST PRIOR TO TAKEOFF
If AV AIR HOT or L or R OIL HOT cautions appear -
5. Perform the appropriate caution corrective action procedures.
The AV AIR HOT caution corrective action procedures should remove the caution if the ECS system
is operating normally. If the caution cannot be cleared with the ECS MODE switch in AUTO,
maintenance action is required.
21.3 IN FLIGHT
At nominal ambient conditions, the aircraft fuel system should provide adequate cooling for the
FADECs and subsystem accessories. With extremely hot ambient conditions, feed tank fuel temperatures can approach the 59°C inflight limit. During low altitude flight in hot conditions, particularly
with a low fuel state, an L or R FUEL HOT caution may appear. If sufficient cooling is unavailable,
the L or R OIL HOT cautions may also appear.
If OAT is approaching or is above 103°F -
1. Monitor feed tank fuel temperatures.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VI-21-1 ORIGINAL
If the L or R FUEL HOT, FADEC HOT, or OIL HOT cautions appear -
2. Perform the appropriate corrective action procedures.
3. Land as soon as practical.
21.4 DESCENT/RECOVERY
The windshield may fog rapidly under conditions of very high aircraft descent rates and high
humidity. In such conditions, consider preheating the windshield by placing the DEFOG handle to
HIGH. If possible, the maximum comfortable cockpit temperature should be maintained to aid in
windshield defog.
If OAT is approaching or is above 103°F -
1. Consider turning off non-essential avionics equipment before entering the landing pattern.
21.5 AFTER LANDING
During ground operations with fuel temperatures above 40°C, the LCS pump and ground cooling fan
are commanded on regardless of RADAR knob position to provide ram air cooling for the fuel system.
Placing the RADAR knob to OFF postflight removes the radar as a heat source, aids LCS/fuel cooling,
and should extend ground operating time.
Once clear of the runway -
1. Avionics equipment - OFF
2. RADAR knob - OFF
If line shutdown -
3. Canopy - LEAVE OPEN
If hotpits -
3. Monitor feed tank fuel temperatures.
NOTE
The ground L or R FUEL HOT caution thresholds are 79°C with less
than 5,000 pounds of fuel and 59°C with more than 5,000 pounds of
fuel.
If feed tank fuel temperatures are approaching limits -
4. Consider shutting down the left engine (significantly reduces the heat load).
If a L or R FUEL HOT caution appears -
5. Perform the corrective action items.

CHAPTER 22
Cold Weather Procedures
22.1 EXTERIOR INSPECTION
If the aircraft has not flown within 4 hr -
1. Pay particular attention to the nosewheel oleo, and APU and brake accumulator pressures.
22.2 BEFORE ENTERING COCKPIT
If a battery/APU start is anticipated -
1. Consider using external power to raise the canopy to conserve battery power.
22.3 INTERIOR CHECK
1. Canopy - Consider leaving open until the right engine has been started to (1) conserve battery
power and (2) permit rapid egress.
If the aircraft has been cold soaked below -18°C (0°F) -
1. Rudder pedal adjustment may be difficult or impossible and the inertia reel may not retract
automatically until the cockpit warms up (typically 5 to 10 minutes).
22.4 ENGINE START
1. Perform normal engine starts (windmilling is not required).
APU starts should be successful if the battery and the APU accumulator are fully charged. The
FADEC modulates fuel flow as required to prevent a hung start. Successful engine starts have been
demonstrated at ambient temperatures down to -40°F without start anomalies; however, expect engine
starts to be slower than at nominal temperatures.
2. Avoid activating any hydraulic actuated system for 2 minutes after both engines are online.
This allows hydraulic fluid to warm both systems and prevents hydraulic seal damage and potential
hydraulic leaks.
3. Oil pressure on the EFD may appear as invalid if 200 psi is exceeded. Maximum oil pressure 2.5
minutes after engine start is 180 psi.
22.5 BEFORE TAXI
If ambient temperature between 0 and 7°C -
1. Minimize engine operation above IDLE to reduce the potential for ice accumulation on the engine
inlet lips. Inlet lip icing can occur at these conditions without the INLET ICE caution.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VI-22-1 ORIGINAL
If visible moisture exists (rain, fog) and the temperature is 7°C (45°F) or less -
1. ENG ANTI ICE switch - ON (after engine start)
2. PITOT ANTI ICE switch - ON (after taxi but prior to takeoff)
If the aircraft has not flown within 4 hr with ambient temperature below -18°C (0°F) -
1. Up to three selections of the FCS exerciser mode may be required in order to obtain a successful
FCS RESET after the initial 2 minute warm-up.
For cold weather operations below -18°C (0°F) -
1. Three arresting hook cycles should be performed to bring extension time within specification (2
seconds is nominal).
2. Proper operation of the OBOGS monitor may not occur until 2 minutes of warm up.
22.6 TAKEOFF
If snow or slush has accumulated on the landing gear -
1. Leave the gear down for 1 minute after takeoff to clear snow or slush.
2. The landing gear may be slow to retract (up to 30 seconds) following cold soak below -18°C (0°F).
Gear retraction times in excess of 15 seconds annunciate the landing gear warning tone.
3. Carefully monitor gear uplock signals (all three landing gear position lights out, landing gear
warning light out).

Communication-Identification
Equipment
23.1 MULTIFUNCTION INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM (MIDS)
MIDS is an advanced, high capacity, jam resistant, digital communication link. MIDS is an
omnidirectional radio that uses frequency-hopping techniques similar to HAVEQUICK, and encryption for security. It is like a Local Area Network (LAN) in that multiple users can access information
simultaneously. MIDS is used to exchange near real-time information among air, ground and sea
elements engaged in tactical operations. LINK 16 equipped platforms can transfer voice and data.
Refer to TACMAN Vol 3 for Tactical information. Refer to Chapter 24 for navigation information.
23.2 ICS - INTERCOM SYSTEM
The ICS provides amplification and distribution of intercockpit voice communications, aircrew-toground crew voice communications, ICS voice alerts and tones, as well as advisory tones originating
external to the ICS.
Volume controls are provided to control headset volume for:
1. Voice Activated Intercom (VOX)
2. Transmit sidetone/aircrew intercom audio/ground crew intercom audio
3. MIDS A audio
4. MIDS B audio
5. RWR audio
6. WPN delivery audio
7. TACAN ident
8. Auxiliary audio (available for other uses).
The ICS is also used to control the following COMM/IFF related functions:
1. Selection of PLAIN voice or CIPHER relay modes (RLY switch).
2. Selection of guard transmit (G XMT) for COMM 1 and 2 (G XMIT switch).
3. Hold or zeroize of IFF crypto code (CRYPTO switch).
4. Selection of IFF Mode 4 cautions, advisories, and voice alerts (MODE 4 switch).
5. Selection of IFF NORM or EMERG operating modes (IFF MASTER switch).

23.2.1 ICS Function Selector Switch (F/A-18F). The ICS function selector switch is located in each
cockpit and is used to select the operating mode for ICS voice communications.
23.2.1.1 ICS Function Selector Switch Front Cockpit (F/A-18F). The switch is located on the ANT
SEL panel on the outboard left console in the front cockpit. In order for a crewmember to communicate
on the ICS, the ICS function switch in that cockpit must be in HOT MIC and the ICS VOL knob must
be set (as desired) above the LO position.
RADIO
ORIDE
Selects HOT MIC in both cockpits and ensures ICS volume is louder than COMM
volume.
HOT MIC Enables the front (rear) cockpit microphone for ICS transmissions.
COLD MIC Disables front (rear) cockpit microphone.
23.2.1.2 ICS Function Selector Switch Aft Cockpit (F/A-18F). The switch is located on the VOL
control panel on the left console in the aft cockpit. In order for a crewmember to communicate on the
ICS, the ICS function switch in that cockpit must be in NORM and the ICS VOL knob must be set (as
desired) above the LO position.
RADIO
ORIDE
Selects HOT MIC in both cockpits and ensures ICS volume is louder than COMM
volume.
NORM Enables aft cockpit microphone for ICS transmissions.
23.2.1.3 ICS Aft Cockpit Kick Switches (F/A-18F Lot 26 and up). Two ICS kick switches are located
on the inboard side of each rudder pedal. These switches are in addition to COMM transmit switches
on the rudder pedals. Either switch will activate the ICS for intercockpit communication.
23.3 VHF/UHF COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
The aircraft has two ARC-210 voice communication radios. The VHF/UHF radios, COMM 1 and
COMM 2, provide air-to-air/air-to-ground voice communications; and, in conjunction with automatic
direction finding (ADF), equipment (If installed), provide a DF function. The radios can be operated
in plain mode, anti-jam (Have Quick 1 or 2) mode, secure mode (KY-58), or relay mode; in either
normal or secure voice. An additional function is generation by either COMM 1 or COMM 2 of a 1,020
hz tone (AM) or a 15 hz tone (FM) which serve as audio cues to the pilot. The COMM 1 and COMM
2 radios operate in the frequency bands listed below. When enabled, integral guard receivers
continuously monitor the emergency guard channels for each frequency band.

Transmission and reception of amplitude and frequency modulated signals (AM and FM) occur in
the respective frequency bands on spaced channels of 5 kHz. Twenty channels in the 30 to 400 MHz
band may be pre-set to assigned frequencies.
23.3.1 VHF/UHF Controls and Indicators. The COMM 1 and COMM 2 are operated by
1. Controls on the UFCD,
2. Controls on the ICS,
3. COMM 1 and 2, MIDS A and B transmit switches on the right (inboard) throttle grip,
4. In the F/A-18F, COMM 1 and 2 transmit switches on the left and right rear cockpit rudder pedals
respectively. The PTT panel controls the rudder pedal selection of COMM 1 or MIDS A, and
COMM 2 or MIDS B. The PTT panel is located on the left hand console LOTs 21-25, and on the left
hand outside bulkhead for LOTs 26 and up.

VII-23-3 ORIGINAL
23.3.1.1 UFCD - Up Front Control Display. The UFCD is on the main instrument panel above the
MPCD. The rear cockpit UFCD is on the main instrument panel above or below the MPCD. See figure
23-2 for top level CNI format. Controls on the UFCD for COMM 1 and 2 are:
1. VOL (volume) 1 and 2 COMM control knobs,
2. COMM 1 and 2 channel select knobs,
3. keypad options and scratchpad display,
4. touch options/displays,
5. ID (identification) button,
6. OFF/BRT (brightness) control knob,
7. CONT (contrast) control knob,
8. SYM (symbology) brightness control knob,
9. EM CON (emission control) pushbutton switch.
10. MIDS - turned on/off by pressing either the TACAN or LINK 16 options, then ON/OFF.
23.3.1.1.1 COMM 1 and 2 VOL (Volume) Control Knobs. Operation of the VOL control knobs is not
dependent on the operation of the MPCD or the UFCD. Each VOL control knob controls power
(on/off) and audio level to the associated COMM 1 and 2 radio. Tick marks on the VOL control knobs
and the face of the UFCD are used to indicate OFF for the associated COMM 1 or 2 radio. Clockwise
rotation from OFF applies power to the associated radio and continued rotation increases the audio
level. On F/A-18F aircraft, the cockpit and rear cockpit VOL control knobs must both be OFF to
remove power from the associated radio. When a radio is powered (on), the associated COMM radio
(unlabeled) touch option/display is corner highlighted (upper left corner).
23.3.1.1.2 COMM 1 and COMM 2 Channel Select Knobs. Operation of the COMM 1 or COMM 2
select knobs is not dependent on the operation of the MPCD or UFCD. Clockwise rotation of either
COMM channel select knob changes the associated COMM 1 or COMM 2 preset channel selections in
the order:
1. CH (1 thru 20) one of twenty preset channels,
2. CH G (guard channel),
3. CH M (manual frequency selection mode),
4. CH C (cue channel/frequency for Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System) (SINCGARS),
5. CH S (ship maritime).
Continued clockwise rotation repeats the change sequence. Counterclockwise rotation reverses the
change sequence. Rotating either COMM select knob to CH G tunes the associated radio to 243.0 MHz
UHF. To communicate on a guard frequency other than 243.0 MHz UHF, a different guard frequency
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-23-4 ORIGINAL
must be manually entered. Rotating either knob with any AJ MENU sublevel selected returns the
UFCD to the COMM sublevel.
23.3.1.1.3 COMM Keypad Options and Scratchpad Display. In the top level CNI format twelve
keypad options and a scratchpad display may be used to change the CH 1 thru 20 preset channel
numbers, CH G (guard) frequency, CH M (manual frequencies), CH C (cue channel/frequency) or CH
S (ship maritime frequencies). The keypad options are 0 thru 9, CLR (clear) and MAN (manual).
23.3.1.1.4 COMM Touch Option/Displays. On the top level CNI format ten touch option/displays
may be used to select COMM 1, COMM 2, or other sublevel formats. The upper right and lower right
touch option/displays are dedicated to the COMM 1 and COMM 2 radios respectively. Selecting other
sublevel formats does not remove the COMM 1 and 2 touch option/displays.
The COMM 1 and COMM 2 channel displays are also utilized to visually identify which audio
sources are currently active. When an active radio transmission is occurring, the upper half of the
COMM 1/2 option is background shaded. When an active MIDS transmission is occurring, the lower
half of the COMM 1/2 option is background shaded.
On Lot 26 and up aircraft with the 8 x 10 display installed, both UFCDs indicate an active
transmission in progress when either cockpit initiates the communication. The active transmission
indication is a rectangular border around the source (upper for COMM, lower for MIDS). When the
active transmit cue is illuminated, the frequency of the related radio is partially covered on the aft
UFCD.
Figure 23-2. Top Level CNI Format on Up Front Control Display (UFCD)

VII-23-5 ORIGINAL
The remaining eight touch option/displays are:
1. D/L, BCN, ILS (data link, beacon and instrument landing system),
2. A/P (autopilot),
3. TCN (TACAN with channel number),
4. IFF (identification friend or foe with mode numbers),
5. DDI (digital display indicator),
6. RALT (radar altimeter with altitude reading),
Channels 10 and 20 are valid entries for Low Altitude Warning settings.
Due to the close proximity of the COMM 1 and RALT touch options/
displays, it is possible to inadvertently change the low altitude warning
setting for the radar altimeter when using COMM 1 fast data entry.
7. EW (electronic warfare),
8. FLR (forward looking infrared radar).
23.3.1.1.5 UFCD OFF/BRT (Brightness) Control Knob. The OFF/BRT control knob adjusts the
overall brightness of the UFCD for both symbology and video. Clockwise rotation from OFF applies
power to the UFCD and progressively increases brightness. Counterclockwise rotation to OFF removes
power from the UFCD. The UFCD does not need to be powered for COMM 1 or 2 to function.
23.3.1.1.6 UFCD CONT (Contrast) Control Knob. Clockwise rotation of the CONT control knob
increases video contrast. Counterclockwise rotation decreases video contrast.
23.3.1.1.7 UFCD SYM (Symbology) Control Knob. Clockwise rotation of the SYM brightness
control knob increases the brightness of the UFCD symbology only. Video brightness is not affected by
this knob.
23.3.1.1.8 EMCON - Emission Control Pushbutton. The EMCON pushbutton switch may be used
to terminate all onboard emitters except COMM transmitters and ALQ-165. If emergency is selected
on the ACI panel, the IFF and D/L respond with emergency, if interrogated. When EMCON is selected
with the EM CON pushbutton switch, emission can be restored only with this switch. When EMCON
is selected with the sensor control switch, emission can be restored with the sensor control switch or the
EM CON pushbutton switch. During EMCON operations, EMCON is displayed in the scratchpad for
top level CNI display or vertically in the left options for DDI displays on the UFCD.
23.3.1.2 COMM Control Panel. The COMM control panel is on the left console. The switches which
are used for VHF/UHF operation are the COMM relay switch and the COMM G XMT select switch.
23.3.1.2.1 RLY (Relay) Switch. The RLY switch, located on the COMM control panel, is used to
enable relay communications by allowing information received through one radio to be routed to the
other radio for transmission. The switch must be placed in the OFF position prior to the initial

23.3.2 COMM 1 and 2 Operation. The operation of COMM 1 and 2 is identical. The following
description addresses only COMM 1; however, it should be understood that the description is
applicable to COMM 2. Power to COMM 1 is applied by rotating the VOL 1 COMM control knob
clockwise. Power application is identified by a corner highlight in the upper left corner of the COMM
1 touch option/display. The channels and preset frequencies (CH 1 thru 20), CH G, CH M, CH C and
CH S may be selected by rotating the COMM 1 channel select knob until the desired CH sub level and
fixed frequency are displayed in the COMM 1 touch option/display. In the anti-jam mode, the fixed
frequency is replaced with H1, H2 or SG. When COMM 1 is actively receiving, the upper half of the
touch option/display is half intensity highlighted. The active receive indication is available only if the
radio is powered.
23.3.2.1 Top Level CNI Format Channel or Manual Frequency Change. In the top level CNI
format, the preset channel number is changed by touching the desired channel number on the keypad
and then touching the COMM 1 touch option/display (fast data entry). If an invalid channel entry is

The RTN option is used to return to the fixed frequency COMM sublevel.
23.4 HAVE QUICK SYSTEM
Have Quick is a slow hopping, UHF, AM line-of-sight jam-resistant voice communication system.
The operation involves coordinating and establishing communications nets. These nets have multiple
users that have the same ECCM information and are time synchronized. The nets are established and
operate with information for a specific word-of-day. The WOD is used to define the frequency hopping
pattern for that day. In conjunction with the WOD, a precise time-of-day (TOD), which is effectively
the net time synchronizer, is also required. The net number and type can be entered using the keypad
options. The three digits to the left of the decimal point are the net number and range from 000 to 999.
The three digits to the right of the decimal point represent type: .025 = HQII (NATO), and .050 = HQII
(non-NATO).
NOTE
The radios do not contain a clock. Time must be set during aircraft
preflight.
The principle functions available for Have Quick control are:
1. Anti-jam (AJ) mode and net selection,
2. Time synchronization including either the reception or the transmission of the TOD,
3. WOD verification and manual entry,
4. Zeroing WOD,
5. Training net control and manual entry.

23.6 KY-58 - SECURE SPEECH SYSTEM
The secure speech system is used for ciphering (coding) or deciphering (decoding) audio routed
through the COMM 1 and COMM 2 receiver-transmitters. The system consists primarily of the KY-58
control panel assembly on the right console. Controls and indicators are on the KY-58 control panel
assembly and on the COMM control panel on the left console.
23.6.1 KY-58 Control Panel Assembly. The control panel assembly functions as a ciphering or
deciphering device for secure speech operation.
23.6.1.1 Ciphered Transmission. During ciphered transmissions, audio from the microphone is
routed through the COMM control panel to the KY-58 control panel assembly where it is enciphered.
The enciphered audio is routed back to the COMM control panel, then to COMM 1 or COMM 2
receiver-transmitter for transmission.
23.6.1.2 Ciphered Reception. During reception of ciphered information, the ciphered audio is
routed from the COMM 1 or COMM 2 receiver-transmitter to the COMM control panel, then to the
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-23-23 ORIGINAL
control panel assembly for deciphering. Deciphered audio is routed to the COMM control panel and
the headset.
23.6.1.3 Ciphered Relay Mode. During ciphered relay mode of operation, ciphered information
received on one radio is routed from the radio, through the COMM control panel to the second radio
for transmission. Ciphered information received on the first radio is also routed through the COMM
control panel to the KY-58 control panel assembly for deciphering. Deciphered audio is routed through
the COMM control panel to the headset. This enables the crewmember to hear deciphered relayed
audio in the ciphered relay mode. When cipher is selected on the COMM control panel immediately
after operating in relay plain, COMM 1 plain, or COMM 2 plain mode of operation, the crewmember
must press the transmit key for either COMM 1 or COMM 2 two times to enable ciphered relay

operations. When the relay aircraft is operating both radios within the same bandwidth, the two
frequency selections must be separated by a minimum of 10 MHz.
23.6.2 KY-58 Controls and Indicators. The only cipher control on the COMM control panel is the
RLY CIPHER/PLAIN switch (relay switch). The controls on the KY-58 control panel assembly are the
MODE select knob, unlabeled fill select knob, VOLUME control knob, and the unlabeled power select
knob (see figure 23-19).
23.6.2.1 KY-58 Mode Select Knob. The mode select knob has positions of P, C, LD, and RV. Placing
the knob to P enables plain mode of operation. Placing the knob to C enables the cipher mode of
operation. With the knob set to LD the load mode of operation is enabled. This mode is used for
loading data into the KY-58 control panel assembly. Information pertaining to the RV knob position
(receiver variable) will be supplied later.
23.6.2.2 KY-58 Fill Select Knob. The fill select knob has positions of 1 thru 6, a Z 1-5 position, and
a Z ALL position. Setting the knob to one of the six positions selects the position to be loaded with
data. Placing the knob to Z 1-5 zeroizes data in positions 1 thru 5. Placing the knob to Z ALL zeroizes
all data in positions 1 thru 6.
23.6.2.3 KY-58 Volume Control Knob. The volume control knob adjusts the volume of the KY-58
control panel assembly audio. The volume control knob should be set to full volume position during
secure voice transmission and reception.
23.6.2.4 KY-58 Power Knob. This knob has positions of ON, OFF, and TD. Placing the knob to ON
turns on power to the KY-58 control panel assembly if cipher mode has been selected. Placing the knob
to OFF removes power to the system. With the knob in TD, power is turned on for the system if cipher
mode has been selected and a time delay is selected for data processing. The knob must be in the TD
position for ciphered relay operations.
23.6.3 KY-58 Operation. Other stations or aircraft involved in cipher or cipher relay communication
must be in either the baseband or diphase mode.

23.7 DIGITAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM (DCS)
DCS provides all of the standard voice communication capabilities of earlier ARC-210 radios, plus
a digital data mode that greatly reduces pilot workload during Close Air Support (CAS) missions. It
enables the pilot to receive 9 line briefs, communicates target and mission data digitally from the
Forward Air Controller (FAC), and provides the capability to feed this information to weapon targeting
and navigation systems. Currently, this mission is handled via verbal communication and manual data
entry. A new communication control panel, incorporated with the Multifunctional Information
Distribution System (MIDS), is needed to interface with the DCS.
In the frequency range of 118.000 through 136.975 MHz, the DCS can be tuned to 8.3 KHz channels
to facilitate air traffic control communications in European air space. Tuning the radio to these
frequencies is performed via the UFCD as in any other band. In this band, however, the entered
frequency is not the actual tuned RF frequency. Refer to figure 23-20 for the convention adopted by
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

23.7.1 VHF/UHF Communication System - DCS. The aircraft voice communications system consists
of an ARC-210 radio (COMM 1), a ARC-210/DCS radio (COMM 2), and KY-58 Secure Speech
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-23-27 ORIGINAL
Equipment. DCS provides its own integrated secure speech encoder/decoder which allows COMM 1
and COMM 2 radios to simultaneously operate in cipher mode.
NOTE
The aircraft COMM 2 radio can also be installed with an ARC-210. In
this configuration, the KY-58 is shared between COMM 1 and COMM
2 as in earlier aircraft.
When operating the COMM 2 radio (either ARC-210 or DCS) in a band that allows selecting AM or
FM, make sure the modulation is selected before the frequency is entered. Failure to do this may not
allow the selected modulation to be accepted into memory.
23.7.1.1 ARC-210/DCS. DCS has additional capabilities which do not exist in the ARC-210. One
such capability is two-way digital data communications using Variable Message Format (VMF) for the
CAS mission. Another is storage of the cryptographic keys COMSEC communications. Finally, 8.3
KHz channel spacing is provided in the 118.00 through 136.975 MHz for Air Traffic Control (ATC)
communications required in European airspace.
23.7.1.1.1 COMM 1 and COMM 2 Volume Controls. The volume of the COMM 1 and COMM 2
radios is controlled by volume controls on the UFC.
23.7.2 DCS COMSEC (Communications Security).
23.7.2.1 Operation. During ciphered transmissions, audio from the aircrew’s microphone is routed
through the ACI panel to the DCS where it is encrypted. During reception of ciphered information, the
ciphered audio is deciphered by the DCS. The deciphered audio is routed back through the ACI panel
to the aircrew’s headset.
23.7.2.2 DDI Controls. Control of the internal DCS cryptographic functions is performed via the
DCS KEY display from the UFC. The DCS KEY display is accessed by selecting DCS on the SUPT
menu, then selecting DCSKY on the NETS (network) display. See figure 23-21. The functions
displayed are crypto keys (KEY1 thru KEY6) and TD (time delay). In F/A-18F aircraft, if one cockpit
has the DCS KEY display accessed, the other cockpit can access it by selecting only DCS on the SUPT
menu.
23.7.2.2.1 TD Control. The time delay mode is enabled by selecting/boxing TD on the DCS KEY
display. A subsequent selection disables time delay and removes the box. The effect of enabling time
delay mode does not take place until CPHR or CPDP has been selected via the UFCD.
23.7.2.2.2 Crypto Key Options. There are six available crypto keys. For example, if KEY1 is loaded
with crypto key data, the option KEY1 appears on the display. If a crypto key has not been loaded with
data, that key option is not displayed. A selected crypto key is indicated with a box around the
corresponding option. Only one crypto key may be selected at a time.
The DCS KEY display initializes to the previously selected crypto key. If the last crypto key selected
has been zeroed, the system selects the next available loaded crypto key. The DCS KEY display
defaults with KEY1 selected.
If CPHR or CPDP is selected and the normal default crypto key has been zeroized, NO FILL is
displayed on the UFCD scratchpad. When the DCS KEY display is selected, NO FILL is removed from
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-23-28 ORIGINAL
the scratchpad. If no crypto keys are loaded, no crypto key options are displayed and a NO KEYS
status appears.
If CPHR or CPDP is selected prior to entering the DCS KEY display, an additional DCS COMSEC
status check is performed upon selection of a crypto key. This check takes approximately 1.5 to 2
seconds. If the DCS COMSEC function is operational there is no change on the DCS KEY display. The
boxed option with the CIPHER ON status indicator means the selected key is valid for use and DCS
COMSEC is operational.
If the status check determines there is a problem with the COMSEC function, the selected/boxed
crypto key option is Xd and a DCSCS advisory appears. However, it is possible the DCS COMSEC
function may be operational with other loaded crypto key options. Each crypto key option would have
to be selected (in CPHR or CPDP mode) to determine if the DCS COMSEC function is inoperable.
An Xd crypto key option may still be selected. If it is selected and the COMSEC error is no longer
indicated, the X is removed. All Xd status indications are cleared upon MC power-up.
If there is a problem with the DCS/COMSEC function, the boxed crypto key variable is covered by
an X. This indicates that DCS COMSEC function is inoperable with the selected crypto key. This does
not rule out the possibility the DCS COMSEC function may be operational with the other loaded
crypto keys. Each of the other crypto keys would have to be selected while in cipher or cipher diphase
modes before it could be determined the DCS COMSEC function is completely inoperable.
When a crypto key is unavailable and the applicable COMM switch is activated, a continuous audio
tone is heard in the headset.
23.7.3 UFCD - DCS. For normal UFCD operations, refer to Part 1, Chapter 2, or Part 7, Chapter 23.
23.7.3.1 ZEROIZE Function. Zeroization of DCS and KY-58 COMSEC KEYS, as well as TRANSEC
KEYS including HQ WODs (HAVE QUICK word of day) and SINCGARS EP (electronic protection),
is accomplished using the UFCD. The selection of the ZERO option causes the display to change to
ZERO ALL ENABLE, and clears the COMSEC and TRANSEC KEYS in the radios and KY-58. Both
COMSEC and TRANSEC KEYS are also zeroized upon pilot ejection. The ZERO ALL ENABLE
option is border highlighted for two seconds, and then the option returns to displaying ZERO. While
the ZERO ALL ENABLE option is displayed, selecting any option other than ZERO ALL ENABLE
causes the option to return to ZERO.
NOTE
The ACI panel IFF emergency switch no longer zeroizes the radios.
The DCS has an internal battery which is used to maintain the COMSEC KEYS in radio memory
during aircraft power transients and when aircraft power is removed. It also provides the energy to
zeroize the radio when the pilot ejects or if the radio is removed from the aircraft.
23.7.4 Relay Mode Of Operation. During cipher relay mode of operation using a DCS and an
ARC-210, encrypted information received on one radio is routed through the ACI panel to the second
radio for transmission. The encrypted information received on the first radio is also routed through the
ACI panel to the KY-58 for deciphering. The decrypted audio is routed back to the ACI panel, then to
the aircrew’s headset.

The DCS COMSEC functions are not utilized during the cipher relay mode. In this mode the DCS
is always commanded to the plain voice mode, and all crypto relay transmissions are encrypted/
decrypted by the KY-58.
Certain constraints apply if cipher relay is selected and ADF bearing is needed. Cipher relay mode
may not be selected if ADF is already selected on COMM 2 (DCS). If ADF is selected on COMM 2 after
cipher relay mode has been enabled, COMM 2 ADF and cipher relay mode must be disabled before
control of DCS plain/CPHR/CHDP modes can be returned to COMM 2. If COMM 2 is an ARC-210,
the above constraints do not apply.
Cipher relay operation must be performed within the COMM 1 and COMM 2 relay band limitations
outlined in figure 23-22.
NOTE
With CPHR or CPDP enabled, selection of PLAIN on the RLY
selector switch (ACI panel) does not activate plain relay mode.

A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-23-31 ORIGINAL
23.7.5.1.1 Mission Initialization. The AMU provides the capability to load the following mission
initialization files: COMM, DCS CAS, DCS NETS, and WYPT S/S. The COMM file contains the radio
presets, HAVE QUICK and SINCGARS data. The DCS CAS file contains pre-planned VMF FTXT
(free text) messages, pre-planned VMF 9-line brief messages, and an empty data file reserved for
inflight received CAS and/or FTXT messages. The DCS NETS file contains a set of network
parameters to be used for a unique network environment used in VMF message communications. The
WYPT S/S file contains a list of waypoint names for the IP (initial point) and control points that are
either entered or received in CAS 9-line briefs. See figure 23-23.
23.7.5.2 Status Monitoring.
23.7.5.2.1 Cautions and Advisories. DCS has the ability to trigger eight advisory messages;
COM1H(2H), COM1S(2S), COM1L(2L), BIT and DCSCS. COM1H(2H) is triggered when HAVE
QUICK time is not loaded. COM1S(2S) is triggered when SINCGARS time is not loaded. COM1L(2L)
advisory is triggered by an error in the MC to radio data loading process. BIT is triggered when a failure
is detected by BIT. DCSCS is triggered when a COMSEC failure is detected.
23.7.5.2.2 BIT Top Level Display. The top level BIT display for DCS is the same as the COM2
format. Status is indicated for DCS as COMM2. See figure 23-24.
23.7.5.2.3 COMM BIT Sub-Level Display. The COMM sub-level BIT display appears when the
COMM option on the top level BIT display is selected. The COMM BIT display for DCS is the same

23.7.5.2.4 Software Configuration. The software configuration for the DCS is checked by selecting
CONFIG on the top level BIT display.
23.8 IDENTIFICATION FRIEND OR FOE (IFF)/COMBINED INTERROGATOR TRANSPONDER (CIT)
The AN/APX−111 CIT is a dual purpose Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system with
transponder and interrogator capabilities. The transponder provides automatic identification of the
aircraft in which it is installed when challenged by a surface or airborne interrogator set and provides
momentary identification of position (I/P) upon request. The interrogator provides airborne target
identification capabilities.
23.8.1 IFF Transponder. The transponder system operates in Modes 1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, C and S. Modes
1, 2, and 3 are selective identification feature (SIF) modes. Modes 4A and 4B are the crypto modes.
Mode C is the altitude reporting mode. Mode S is used in conjunction with the Civil Air Traffic Control
Surveillance System and is only available with MC OFP H4E AND UP.
With the IFF Programming (IFF PROG) page: A) Mode 1, 2, and 3 codes can be automatically
programmed to change at specified times or on a time interval, B) Mode 1, 2, 3, 4, C, and S can be
automatically programmed to enable/disable when the aircraft crosses a designated waypoint in a
specified direction, and C) Mode 4 can be automatically updated on Zulu day transition. The IFF can
also be programmed during mission planning.
The IFF emergency mode automatically becomes active upon ejection or can be manually selected
with the IFF MASTER switch.

23.8.1.1 IFF on Top Level CNI UFCD Format. On the top level CNI UFCD format, IFF power
application is identified by a corner highlight in the upper left corner of the IFF option. The option
displays the current Mode 1 and Mode 3 codes regardless of whether the IFF is powered or whether the
mode is enabled. The Mode 1 code may be changed by selecting two valid numbers (first digit equal
to 0−7, second digit equal to 0−3) and selecting the IFF option. Mode 2 and Mode 3 codes may be
changed by selecting four valid numbers (each digit equal to 0−7) and selecting the IFF option.
23.8.1.2 IFF Transponder UFCD Sublevel. The IFF Transponder (XPOND) UFCD sublevel is
displayed by selecting the IFF option before entering any data in the scratchpad (figure 23−25). This
sublevel is used to control power to the IFF system, to enable the transponder modes, to set Mode 1,
2, and 3 codes, to select Mode 4A or 4B, to view Mode S status, to set the temporary Mode S address,
and to select the Mode S sublevel. (See 23.8.1.2.1 for Mode S operation.)
The IFF is on when the ON/OFF option is corner highlighted and displays ON. The IFF system is
off when the option is not corner highlighted and displays OFF.
The Mode 1, 2, 3, C, 4A/4B options are border highlighted when selected for enable. A mode option
without a border highlighted is not selected for enable. Modes 1, 2, 3 and C may be selected for enable
or disable when the IFF system is either on or off. The IFF must be on to select Modes 4A or 4B. Any
mode that is border highlighted with the IFF system on is immediately enabled; any mode that is
border highlighted with the IFF system off is automatically enabled when the IFF system is turned on.
Modes 1, 2, and 3 are enabled and disabled by selecting the respective option. Mode C can not be
enabled without Mode 3 enabled, so enabling Mode C automatically enables Mode 3 and disabling
Mode 3 automatically disables Mode C. With MC OFP H4E AND UP, Mode 3 and Mode C are
combined as one option, so when neither Mode 3 nor Mode C is enabled, selecting the Mode 3/C option
results in the following sequence: both Mode 3 and Mode C enabled − Mode 3 enabled and Mode C
disabled − both Mode 3 and Mode C disabled (figure 23−26). The altitude encoding mode uses 29.92
inches Hg as a reference. When the KIV−6 is installed and the IFF is on, Mode 4A or Mode 4B can be
enabled. Selecting the Mode 4A option results in the following sequence: Mode 4A enabled − Mode 4A
disabled and legend changes to 4B − Mode 4B enabled − Mode 4B disabled and legend changes to 4A.
If the KIV−6 is not installed or the IFF is off, the Mode 4A/4B option is not displayed.
The Mode 1 code may be changed by selecting two valid numbers (first digit equal to 0−7, second
digit equal to 0−3) and selecting the Mode 1 option. The Mode 2 and 3 codes may be changed by
selecting four valid numbers (each digit equal to 0−7) and selecting the respective Mode option.
23.8.1.2.1 Mode S (MC OFP H4E AND UP). Mode S is a Civil Air Traffic Control Surveillance System
that can respond to selective interrogations and provide air-to-air and air-to-ground data of aircraft ID,
state, and intent information. The carriage and operation of Mode S Elementary Surveillance
functionality applies to aircraft that fly Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) and Visual Flight Rules (VFR)
flights in Mode S designated airspace.
The integration of Mode S Level 2 into Navy aircraft is divided into two surveillance levels,
Elementary (EL) and Enhanced (EN). It is beneficial to air traffic control to incorporate Enhanced
Surveillance to the extent practical on all Navy aircraft and to populate Enhanced Surveillance data
parameters to the extent permitted by existing aircraft sensors. As a result of the requirements,
Elementary Mode S is incorporated via a software modification to the CIT system. The system
provides most of the functionality of Enhanced Mode S, but for flight planning purposes only
Elementary Mode S is supported.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-23-35 ORIGINAL
When Elementary Surveillance is selected, the aircraft transmits the following data:
1. 24 bit aircraft address
2. Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) Mode 3/A
3. Aircraft Identification (call sign used in flight)
4. Transponder Capability Report
5. Altitude reporting in 100 ft intervals
6. Flight Status (airborne/on ground)
When Enhanced Surveillance is selected, the aircraft transmits the following data:
1. Elementary Surveillance data
2. Magnetic Heading
3. Indicated Airspeed

All Mode S equipped aircraft have a permanent Mode S address which is assigned to the aircraft
BuNo. The permanent address is stored in DFIRS. A temporary Mode S address may also be used.
When available, the temporary address overrides the permanent address. Once a temporary Mode S
address has been entered, to revert back to the permanent Mode S address, it is necessary to enter the
permanent address as a temporary address.
The use of the same Mode S address in any two airborne aircraft presents
a safety of flight risk as air traffic computers cannot differentiate between
the two aircraft.
The MC requests the permanent Mode S address from DFIRS when Mode S is enabled and a
temporary Mode S address is not available. The permanent address is displayed on the Electronic
Boresight Constant (EBC) Entry sublevel when available with WonW. This is where the aircraft BuNo
Figure 23-26. Mode 3 and Mode C Selection

VII-23-37 ORIGINAL
and permanent address can be entered by maintainers prior to flight. Figure 23−27 demonstrates the
path to the EBC to verify the BuNo and permanent address.
NOTE
If ERROR flashing persists with attempts to enter a valid address, this
indicates a DFIRS malfunction.
The Mode S transponder transmits acquisition squitters (unsolicited transponder replies) to permit
passive acquisition by interrogators. The acquisition squitter function is disabled if Mode S is turned
off.
Prior to takeoff, the aircrew can check the availability/status of Mode S, Mode S acquisition squitter,
permanent Mode S address, temporary Mode S address, and aircraft call sign. The aircrew can enter
an A/C call sign if desired or if mission planning does not provide one. The default A/C call sign
contains VV followed by the aircraft’s BuNo.
Mode S and the acquisition squitter function in the same manner during dual and single MC
operation. In the event that power is removed from both MC1 and MC2, Mode S data ages out. The
CIT continues to provide Mode S transmissions in Level 1 mode, providing the Mode S address at a
minimum.

1. Mode S Option on Transponder UFCD Sublevel. With the IFF system on, the Mode S
option on the UFCD Transponder (XPOND) sublevel indicates the current status of the Mode S
transponder (figure 23−28). The first line of the Mode S option indicates the selected Mode S
surveillance and acquisition squitter options. Enhanced surveillance is indicated by ″EN″ and
Elementary surveillance by ″EL″. An ″S″ after the slash indicates the squitter is enabled (e.g., S−EN/S)
and a dash indicates the squitter is disabled (e.g., S−EN/−) (figure 23−29). The second and third lines
indicate the temporary Mode S address. When a mission planning input is available, those Mode S
surveillance and acquisition squitter options and the temporary address are displayed. Otherwise, the
system defaults to Enhanced surveillance and squitter enabled (S−EN/S). Regardless of the Mode S
options selected, Mode S is disabled at power up.
The first selection of the Mode S option boxes the option and enables the displayed Mode S
functions. The second selection of the Mode S option displays the Mode S UFCD sublevel (figure
23−30).
If neither the permanent nor temporary Mode S address is available, Mode S is disabled, the Mode
S option is Xd out, and the first line displays ″S−″. If no temporary address has been provided by
mission planning or aircrew entry, all zeroes (00000000) are displayed (figure 23−31). A new temporary
address can be entered by selecting eight valid numbers (all digits equal to 0−7 and can not contain all
7’s or all 0’s) and selecting the Mode S option.

2. Mode S UFCD Sublevel. The Mode S sublevel is used to enable/disable the acquisition
squitter, select Enhanced or Elementary surveillance, and enter the aircraft call sign and temporary
address (figure 23−30). If the aircrew changes Mode S selections and disables Mode S, the aircrew’s
selections return when Mode S is re-enabled.
a. Temporary Mode S Address. The temporary Mode S address is displayed on the TEMP S option.
The temporary address can be provided via mission planning or aircrew entry. If a temporary address
is not available, all zeros (00000000) are displayed. A new temporary address can be entered by
selecting eight valid numbers (all digits equal to 0−7 and can not contain all 7’s or all 0’s) and selecting
the TEMP S option.
b. Mode S Surveillance Level. The Mode S Enhanced (S−EN) and Elementary (S−EL) Surveillance
level options are mutually exclusive. Selection of either option enables that option and disables the
other option. If neither option is enabled, enabling one option also enables the acquisition squitter (S
ACQ SQUIT). If both options are disabled, Mode S and the acquisition squitter are disabled.
c. Mode S Acquisition Squitter. Selecting the Mode S acquisition squitter (S ACQ SQUIT) option
toggles the squitter between enabled and disabled. When the squitter is disabled by selecting the
option, it remains disabled until enabled again by aircrew. The squitter is also disabled when Mode S
is not selected (S−EN and S−EL are deselected at the same time). Whether the squitter was disabled
by the S ACQ SQUIT option or S−EN and S−EL deselect, selecting S ACQ SQUIT enables S ACQ
SQUIT and the previous Mode S surveillance level (S−EN or S−EL). Squitter status is also displayed
Figure 23-29. Return to XPOND Format with Squitter Disabled

VII-23-41 ORIGINAL
on the XPOND sublevel Mode S option. An ″S″ after the slash indicates enabled (e.g., S−EN/S) and
a dash indicates disabled (e.g., S−EN/−) (figure 23−29). The SQTTR advisory is also displayed
anytime Mode S is enabled while the acquisition squitter is disabled. The SQTTR advisory is cleared
when either Mode S is disabled or the acquisition squitter is enabled.
Keep Mode S acquisition squitter enabled (boxed) when Mode S is
enabled. Disabling Mode S acquisition squitter with Mode S enabled does
not allow TCAS in nearby aircraft to acquire track.
d. Mode S Aircraft Call Sign. The Mode S aircraft (A/C) call sign is displayed on the CALL SN
option. If the A/C call sign has not been made available from the aircrew or mission planning, the
default A/C call sign is VV plus the BuNo (e.g., VV166855). The A/C call sign may be changed by
selecting the CALL SN option which displays the A/C call sign UFCD sublevel and alphanumeric
keypad (figure 23−32). Valid A/C call signs are limited to no more than eight letters and numbers.
Leading or embedded spaces between characters in the A/C call sign are not accepted. Selecting the
CALL SN option after entering the new A/C call sign changes the call sign.

(POS) group information. There are 15 distinct times and 2 positions which can be entered.
With the TIME option boxed, the MC automatically updates the selected IFF codes at the specified
time. For each specified time, transponder codes may be set for Modes 1, 2, and 3. The times are
referenced to aircraft Zulu time of day (ZTOD) in the format of hours:minutes. The first column of a
TIME data line contains the ZTOD at which the codes are updated followed by the Mode 1, 2, and 3
code columns.
With the POS option boxed, the MC automatically enables/disables the selected Modes 1, 2, 3, C,
and S transponder functions and can enable the Mode 4 transponder and interrogator functions at the
designated waypoint. Mode 4 transponder and interrogator functions can not be automatically
disabled. A POS group data line consists of the group number, the list of the modes to be affected in
this group, whether the modes are enabled/disabled, and the cardinal direction and waypoint
combination to specify the location where the modes are enabled/disabled.
With the AUTO M4 option boxed, Mode 4 for both the transponder and the interrogator switches
from ″A″ to ″B″ when the aircraft clock passes through 00:00 Zulu time. If Mode 4 is already ″B″, this
feature has no effect.
The MC automatically disables the TIME and POS updates when Automatic Carrier Landing
(ACL) is selected. Once disabled, the desired automatic update state may be manually reselected. The
AUTO M4 feature is never automatically disabled.
When the EDIT option is selected, the IFF PROG EDIT sublevel is displayed.
23.8.4.2 IFF PROG EDIT Sublevel. The IFF PROG EDIT sublevel is used to select the time, mode
codes, position data and modes to be enabled/disabled and is displayed when the EDIT option on the
IFF PROG page is selected. The selection box indicates the currently selected data line. Selection
arrows are used to change the current selected data line. The CLEAR option clears the currently
selected data. The RETURN option returns to the IFF PROG page.
23.8.4.2.1 TIME Data. When editing a TIME data line, M1, M2, M3 and INTVL options are
displayed. When M1, M2, or M3 is selected, a UFCD format is displayed which allows aircrew to enter
the Zulu time for the currently selected data line as well as input the exact code to be used in the
selected mode. The mode code is selected by entering a valid code and selecting the UFCD CODE
option. The selected mode code is displayed in the appropriate mode column on the IFF PROG page
and in the CODE option. If no mode code has been selected, the column on the IFF PROG page is
blank and the CODE option displays zeros. Time is selected by entering a valid four digit Zulu time and
selecting the UFCD TIME option. The selected time is displayed in the TIME column on the IFF
PROG page and in the TIME option. The selection arrows on the UFCD allow the aircrew to scroll
sequentially through the times entered on the IFF PROG page.
When a new time is entered, the TIME data lines are sorted in increasing time order based on
current aircraft time. The earliest later time is displayed first, followed by the remaining times in
sequential order. The selection box is moved automatically when the data line is edited. Times that are
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-23-44 ORIGINAL
earlier than the current aircraft time are assumed to be specified for the next Zulu day. When a TIME
data line is CLEAR’ed, the data lines are re−sorted, moving the data selection box and the newly
cleared data line to the bottom of the display.
A TIME data line is considered invalid if it contains valid code entries but does not contain a valid
time. Invalid data lines are displayed at the bottom of the display and are not used by the IFF.
When INTVL is selected, a UFCD format is displayed which allows aircrew to enter a start time and
single time interval for changing the IFF codes automatically. Start time is selected by entering a valid
four digit Zulu time and selecting the UFCD START TIME option. The selected start time is displayed
in the START TIME option. The time interval is selected by entering a valid time interval (1−99
minutes) and selecting the UFCD LNGTH option. The selected time interval is displayed in the
LNGTH option.
When a start time and time interval are entered, all existing times are recomputed. The start time
is displayed in the first TIME data line with subsequent times equal to the previous time plus the time
interval. The codes currently specified for each data line are not changed.
23.8.4.2.2 POS Data When editing a POS group data line, M1, M2, M3, M4, MC, MS mode options,
ENBL/DSBL and cardinal direction options are displayed (figure 23−33). In order for group data line
to be valid, the following must occur: 1) At least one mode must be selected, 2) a direction must be
selected, 3) and a waypoint must be entered.
The mode options toggle the modes to be enabled or disabled into and out of the selected group. The
ENBL/DSBL option toggles between enabling and disabling the currently selected modes in the group.
The option affects all of the modes presently selected in the group. When the DSBL option is selected,
Figure 23-32. Mode S A/C Call Sign Sublevel
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-23-45 ORIGINAL
DSBL is displayed in the selected group and all modes listed are disabled when the aircraft reaches the
designated waypoint. When the ENBL option is selected, ENBL is displayed in the selected group and
all modes listed are enabled when the aircraft reaches the designated waypoint. Since Mode 4 can not
be automatically disabled, whenever the selected POS group data line displays DSBL, the M4 option
is Xd out. Also, if M4 is displayed in the selected POS group data line, the DSBL option is Xd out.
To designate the waypoint, one of the cardinal direction (N, S, E, W) options must be selected. The
selected cardinal direction is the direction the aircraft must pass the designated waypoint in order to
cause the selected modes to be enabled or disabled automatically. When a cardinal direction option is
selected, a UFCD format is displayed which allows aircrew to enter the designated waypoint. The
waypoint is selected by entering a valid waypoint number (0−99) and selecting the UFCD WYPT
option. The selected waypoint number is displayed in the WYPT option. The selected waypoint
number and cardinal direction are displayed in the group data line.
23.8.5 IFF Controls.
23.8.5.1 IDENT (ID) Button. The ID button is located on left side of the UFCD and is used to
manually squawk ident. Pressing the ID button enables the IFF system to transmit identification of
position for approximately 18 seconds.
23.8.5.2 Emission Control Button. The emission control button is located on the right side of the
UFCD and is labeled EMCON. Pressing the EMCON button changes the IFF, if ON, to a standby
Figure 23-33. IFF PROG EDIT Sublevel - POS Data

mode so that it cannot transmit. At the same time, EMCON is displayed in the scratchpad for top level
displays or vertically in the left options for DDI displays on the UFCD. When EMCON is turned off
by pressing the button again, the IFF returns to the previous operating mode.
23.8.5.3 IFF Control Panel. The IFF control panel is located on the left hand console and contains
the MASTER switch, the MODE 4 switch, and the CRYPTO switch. The MODE 4 and CRYPTO
switches are used for Mode 4 on aircraft which have the KIV−6 installed.
23.8.5.3.1 MASTER Switch. This switch has positions of NORM and EMERG.
NORM IFF replies to interrogations with selected codes.
EMERG IFF replies to interrogations with emergency replies. The IFF transponder turns on
if off. This selection also zeroes the ARC−210 radios.
23.8.5.3.2 MODE 4 Switch. This switch has positions of DIS/AUD, DIS, and OFF.
DIS/AUD Enables IFF 4 caution and ″MODE 4 REPLY″ voice alert, M4 OK and IFFAI
advisories, and the Mode 4 audio tone.
DIS Disables the Mode 4 audio tone. The IFF 4 caution and ″MODE 4 REPLY″ voice
alert, and M4 OK and IFFAI advisories are enabled.
OFF Disables IFF 4 caution and ″MODE 4 REPLY″ voice alert, M4 OK and IFFAI
advisories, and the Mode 4 audio tone.
23.8.5.3.3 CRYPTO Switch. This switch has positions of HOLD, NORM, and ZERO. The switch is
spring-loaded to the NORM position.
NOTE
Ensure the MIDS terminal is on, by ensuring L16 or TACAN is ON,
prior to any attempt to zeroize IFF Mode 4 Crypto Keys via the
CRYPTO switch.″
HOLD Mode 4 codes are retained after power has been turned off if HOLD has been
selected after the landing gear handle has been raised and lowered.
NORM Mode 4 codes are available until power is turned off after the landing gear handle
has been raised and lowered.
ZERO Mode 4 codes are zeroized (erased).
23.8.5.4 IFF Antenna Select Switch. The IFF antenna select switch is located on the ANT SEL
panel on the left console. When the switch is moved from BOTH to either UPPER or LOWER, the
selection remains in effect for only 60 seconds, at which time the IFF automatically switches to BOTH.
If the IFF switch remains in either UPPER or LOWER, a false indication of the antenna exists after
the 60 second time limit. With WonW, the time limit is not in effect and the IFF operates in accordance
with the position of the IFF antenna select switch.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-23-47 ORIGINAL
UPPER Selects upper antenna.
BOTH Provides automatic antenna selection.
LOWER Selects lower antenna.
23.8.6 IFF Related Cautions and Advisories. The following IFF related cautions and advisories are
described in the Warning/Caution/Advisory Displays in Part V:
• IFF 4 caution
• IFF OVRHT caution
• MODE 4 REPLY voice alert
• EBC advisory
• IFFAI advisory
• M4 OK advisory
• SQTTR advisory
23.9 COMMUNICATION-NAVIGATION-IDENTIFICATION INTERFACE
The radios, ADF, TCN, ILS, data link, radar beacon, and IFF interface with the aircrew through the
UFCD. The UFCD power and symbology are provided by the MPCD. As commands are entered into
the UFCD, the MPCD transmits those commands to the mission computer. The MC accepts those
commands and transmits them either directly to the CNI equipment if it is MUX compatible or to the
CSC if it is not. For non-MUX CNI equipment, the CSC converts the commands to analog or discrete
information and directly interfaces with the equipment. The CSC also converts standby attitude
signals used in the electronic attitude display indicator (EADI) and if the CSC fails the EADI is not
available.

CHAPTER 24
Navigation Equipment
Navigation equipment consists of the following: Inertial Navigation System (INS, AN/ASN-139)
and Global Positioning System (GPS AN/ASN-163), or Accurate Navigation System (ANAV,
AN/ASN−181), which includes the INS and GPS, TACAN (RT 1159A/ARN-118, if installed),
Instrument Carrier Landing System (ICLS, AN/ARA-63), Data Link (D/L, RT/1379A/ASW), and
Automatic Direction Finder (ADF, OA-8697/ADR, if installed). When installed, the Multifunctional
Information Distribution System (MIDS) also serves as a navigation aid by providing TACAN and
precise relative navigation position keeping functions.
24.1 NAVIGATION CONTROLS AND INDICATORS
Navigation controls and indicators consist of the UFCD, MPCD, DDIs, HUD, INS mode switch,
course set switch, and COMM control panel. These controls and indicators are integrated in the
navigation system. MPCD and HUD symbology, and UFCD functions are described in Chapter 2.
24.1.1 UFCD Navigation Controls. The UFCD allows: ON/OFF operation of the ILS, TACAN, D/L,
and ADF; data entry for the TACAN and INS; and mode selection for the D/L.
24.1.2 Moving Map - Digital Map Set (DMS). (LOTs 21-24) The DMS utilizes the MPCD to provide
the pilot/WSO with a high resolution color map display for day/night navigation. The DMS display can
be selected on the front or rear MPCD or any DDI; however, a DDI only displays a monochrome image.
(LOTs 25 and up) The DMS is displayed in color and can be displayed on any AMPD, and the front
and rear MPCD.
24.1.2.1 MAP Option (HSI Option). The MAP option provides on/off control of the DMS map when
selected from an MPCD (MAP option is boxed when the map is ON). When MAP is selected from a
DDI, the HSI format source alternates between stroke (DDI symbol generator) and raster (DMS
mono-map) on all DDIs displaying the HSI format. The DMS map is commanded ON for the LDDI
and the MPCD when the raster HSI is selected on the DDI.
When map update is selected from the front cockpit MPCD, the TDC is assigned to the map slew
function. When map update is selected from the rear cockpit MPCD, the LDC is assigned to the map
slew function (if the LDDI is not communicating on the AVMUX, the RDC is assigned). When map
update is selected from the right or left DDI, the RDC or LDC, respectively, is assigned to the map slew
function. When map update is selected, MAP is automatically boxed. When map update is selected on
a DDI, all DDIs displaying the HSI format are driven by the DMS mono-map.
24.1.2.1.1 Moving Map Range Scales. For HSI in T UP (track up) or N UP (true north up), valid
range scale/map type combinations are as follows: 40/1:2M, 20/1:2M-ZOOM, 10/1:500K, 5/1:250K.
For HSI in DCTR (decenter), valid range scale/map type combinations are as follows: 80/1:2M,
40/1:2M-ZOOM, 20/1:500K, 10/1:250K.
Map compatible range scales are:
1. Centered (5, 10, 20, & 40 nm)
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-1 ORIGINAL
2. Decentered (10, 20, 40, & 80 nm)
24.1.3 HSI Format. The MPCD displays TACAN, INS (also INS alignment data), D/L, ILS, and
ADF navigation symbology. The MPCD also allows selection of various TACAN, ILS, INS, and D/L
functions using the MPCD option pushbuttons. See figure 24-1.
The HSI format displayed on the MPCD is driven by the MPCD symbology overlaying the DMS
color map. The HSI format displayed on the DDI is driven by either a mono-map output from the DMS
or a DDI symbol generator. The DMS mono-map output contains the same information as the DMS
color output except for color, including cautions if they are provided with the color output. If the DMS
fails, the color map is unavailable; however, all stroke formats are available for display.
Navigation symbols and digital readouts are normally displayed on the MPCD. One of three TDC
assignment symbols can be displayed in the upper right corner of a TDC compatible display, to
indicate a TDC is assigned to the display in the front cockpit only, rear cockpit only, or both cockpits.
When a TDC is assigned to the map slew function, SLEW is displayed in the upper right corner of the
HSI display along with one of three arrows to indicate TDC assignment to the display in the front
cockpit only, rear cockpit only, or both cockpits.
24.1.3.1 HSI Option. This option returns the operator to the Top Level HSI format after the DMS
has been configured for operation. The HSI option coincides with the other HSI options found on
similar HSI formats to ensure consistency between formats. See figure 24-2.
24.1.3.2 MODE Option (HSI Format). The HSI display MODE option is located adjacent to the
center left push button of the DDI or MPCD. Selecting the MODE option enables T UP, N UP, DCTR,
MAP, and slew options to be displayed on the left side of the HSI display. At aircraft power-up/WonW,
the system initializes to map boxed (on), centered, T UP, and 40 nm scale.
24.1.3.2.1 MAP Operating Mode Option. This multifunction option combines the Chart (CHRT),
digital terrain elevation data (DTED), and controlled image base (CIB) map operating modes into a
single option. See figure 24-2.
24.1.3.3 MODE Backup. If aircraft magnetic heading or aircraft horizontal velocities become invalid,
the HSI format is limited to a centered north-up mode and the T UP and DCTR legends are removed
and selection inhibited from the HSI Mode sublevel. The N UP legend on the HSI Mode sublevel is
boxed under this condition. When aircraft magnetic heading and aircraft horizontal velocities become
valid, the HSI format is driven to the currently selected mode and the T UP, N UP and DCTR legends
are provided and processed on the HSI Mode sublevel.
NOTE
The currently selected HSI format mode option remains unchanged
when the aircraft magnetic heading or aircraft horizontal velocities
become invalid.

24.1.3.3.1 MAP Modes/Data Products. Each of the map modes (CHRT, DTED, and CIB) provides
a different plan-view map/image. The actual presentation and availability of the different maps/
images are independent and mutually exclusive. Only one map mode can be selected at any one time.
The detailed images and associated area coverage for each mode are dependent on the map (theater)
data loaded in the DMS or installed on the mission card. Each plan-view map, regardless of mode,
presents an image that can support moving map capability and/or slew mode functions. When toggling
through the different modes, different map images are available providing the mode specific data is
loaded/available for that particular geographic position and scale. The map modes and their associated
data products are:
1. Chart (CHRT) mode provides a plan-view color map derived from Compressed ARC Digitized
Raster Graphics (CADRG). This chart product replaces the Compressed Aeronautical Chart (CAC)
map data currently used in the existing map (AN/ASQ-196).
2. Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) mode provides a plan-view, panchromatic (gray scale),
terrain plot with slope shading.
3. Controlled Image Base (CIB) mode provides a plan-view panchromatic image derived from a
variety of mission planning, command, control, communications, and intelligence systems.
24.1.3.4 Map Data. The MDATA option is provided on the HSI/DATA sublevel format. MDATA is
boxed when selected and remains boxed until A/C, WYPT, TCN, HSI, or INS CK is selected. When
MDATA is selected, the DATA option is provided on the UFCD. When MDATA is selected on the
HSI, all DDI/MPCD/UFCD with the HSI format are driven by the DMS mono-map and the data
frames written in raster. The number of data frames is limited to 100.
24.1.3.4.1 Map Orientation Option. This option is a multifunction option that combines the Track
Up (T UP) and North Up (N UP) map orientation functions into a single option. Successive selections
of the orientation option toggles the map between these two orientations as they are mutually
exclusive. The T UP orientation is the default orientation. The DMS mono-map output contains the
same information as the DMS color output (except for color), including cautions if they are provided
with the color output. See figure 24-2.
24.1.3.5 SLEW Option (HSI Format). When map update is selected from the cockpit, the TDC is
assigned to the slew function. When map update is selected from the rear MPCD, the LDC is assigned
to the slew function (if the left DDI has malfunctioned the right designator control (RDC) is assigned).
When map update is selected from the right or left DDI the RDC or LDC, respectively, is assigned to
the map slew function. When map update is selected, MAP is automatically boxed and when selected
on a DDI, all DDIs and MPCDs displaying the HSI display are commanded to be driven by the DMS
monochromatic map.
When WYPT slew is selected from the cockpit, the TDC is assigned to the MAP Slew function for
waypoint update. When WYPT Slew is selected from the aft MPCD, the LDC is assigned to the MAP
slew function for waypoint update (if the LDDI is not communicating on the AVMUX, the RDC is
assigned). When WYPT Slew is selected from the right or left DDI, the RDC or LDC, respectively, is
assigned to the map slew function for waypoint update. When WYPT Slew is selected, MAP is
automatically boxed. When WYPT slew is selected on a DDI, all DDIs and UFCDs displaying the HSI
format are commanded to be driven by the DMS mono-map.
24.1.3.6 POS/XXX Option (HSI Format). This option is located along the top row of the HSI display
and when selected provides the POS/XXX sublevel display. This sublevel display allows the selection
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-6 ORIGINAL
of AINS, INS, GPS, MIDS (if installed), ADC, or TCN as the position keeping source. When one of
these options is selected the top level HSI display is returned, with the appropriate selection denoted
(Ex. POS/ADC). POS/INS is automatically selected during ground operations when INS data is valid.
Without MIDS, should the INS fail, the MC automatically begins position keeping with FCS air data
function (ADC) from the last valid INS position. If MIDS is installed and operating, MIDS is
automatically selected as the aircraft position keeping source if GPS and INS fail or become degraded.
Because MIDS position keeping is unreliable and inflight alignment is not possible when in
POS/MIDS, air data position keeping (POS/ADC) should be manually selected if POS/MIDS is
displayed.
24.1.3.7 UPDT Option (HSI Format). The UPDT option is located along the top row of the HSI
display and when selected provides the UPDT sublevel display. This sublevel display allows the
selection of VEL (velocity), TCN, DSG (designation), AUTO, or MAP as the update source. Following
the selection of one of the update options, an ACPT/REJ (accept/reject) display is presented in which
the update can either be accepted or rejected. After selection of ACPT or REJ, the top level HSI
display is returned. There is no ACPT/REJ display presented when the AUTO option is selected.
Velocity update is described in the A1-F18EA-TAC-000. If a previous update has been accepted, a
CANCEL option is also displayed on the UPDT sublevel to allow the aircrew to cancel the last accepted
update.
24.1.3.8 MK Option (HSI Format). This option is located along the top row of the HSI display. The
mark option is initialized to MK1 upon power up with WonW, regardless of the previous selection. A
maximum of nine mark points may be entered. If all mark points have been used and another mark
point is entered, MK1 is replaced with the new mark data.
If a waypoint/OAP is not designated and the MK option is selected, the lat/long of the current
overfly point is stored with the elevation set to zero. If a location is designated, the lat/long of the
designated location is stored. In this situation, the aircraft altitude minus the altitude above the
designated target is stored as the elevation.
24.1.3.9 DATA Option (HSI Format). The data option is located along the top row of the HSI display.
Selecting this option provides the DATA sublevel display. This display is used to enter waypoint/OAP
data, aircraft data, TACAN data, waypoint/OAP sequence data, radar and barometric altitude
warning, groundspeed data, and TOT data; and to select the INS check display. After selection of
either the WYPT, A/C, or TCN option, the UFC or SEQUFC option is used to initialize the UFCD for
data entry. The HSI option is used to return the HSI display to the top level format.
24.1.3.10 WYPT, OAP Option (HSI Format). The WYPT, OAP option is located along the right side
of the HSI. WYPT is displayed when steering is to a waypoint. OAP is displayed when steering is to
an OAP. If either the WYPT or OAP option is selected (boxed), direct great circle steering is provided
to that waypoint/OAP. TGT is displayed at this location when a target is designated.
24.1.3.10.1 Waypoint, OAP, Mark Point Selection. Along the right side of the HSI display just below
the WYPT/OAP/TGT options, there are two arrows pointing in opposite directions with a number in
between. This number indicates the current steer to waypoint/OAP/mark. The waypoint/OAP being
steered to can be incremented/decremented by selecting the appropriate arrow option, changing the
steer to number. After all of the waypoints/OAPs have cycled through (0 through 59), the mark points
can be selected for display. Marks are displayed with an M preceding the number.
24.1.3.11 WPDSG, O/S Option (HSI Format). This option is located along the right side of the HSI
display. Selecting this option designates a waypoint/OAP for weapon computations, sensor slaving,
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-7 ORIGINAL
steering, or position updating. Selecting the WPDSG option designates the waypoint/OAP. After
designating a waypoint, the WPDSG option is removed and TGT replaces WYPT. After designating
an OAP, OAP remains boxed and O/S replaces WPDSG. When O/S is selected, the offset point is
designated, TGT replaces OAP, and O/S is removed.
24.1.3.12 SEQ # Option (HSI Format). The SEQ # option is located along the right side of the HSI
display. At power up with WonW, this option initializes to SEQ1 (unboxed). Successive actuations of
the option toggles through a display sequence in the following order: SEQ1 (boxed), SEQ2 (unboxed),
SEQ2 (boxed), SEQ3, (unboxed), SEQ3, (boxed), SEQL, (unboxed), SEQL, (boxed), and back to SEQ1
(unboxed). With the SEQ # option boxed, dashed lines are displayed connecting the waypoints of that
sequence. The dashed lines connecting the waypoints (SEQ # boxed) are displayed for all HSI range
scales and all HSI modes. The dashed lines are removed when magnetic heading is invalid, aircraft
position is invalid, or map slew is selected.
24.1.3.13 AUTO Option (HSI Format). The AUTO option is located along the bottom of the HSI
display. Selecting the AUTO option provides auto sequential steering to the first waypoint in the
selected sequence; boxing the AUTO and WYPT or OAP option (if not already boxed). Selecting the
AUTO option while boxed deselects auto sequential steering and unboxes the AUTO option. The
AUTO option is removed when:
1. The INS is in an alignment mode
2. INS heading failure occurs
3. Magnetic is invalid
4. Aircraft present position is invalid
5. Aircraft ground track is invalid
6. Selected sequence contains less than two waypoints
7. Aircraft is in auto or velocity update
8. FCS is coupled to the D/L
9. A ground point is designated
24.1.3.14 TIMEUFC Option (HSI Format). The TIMEUFC option is located along the bottom row of
the HSI display. The TIMEUFC option is removed from the HSI format during a GND or IFA GPS
alignment until the qual number is 6.2 or better, and is never displayed during a CV alignment.
Selecting this option boxes TIMEUFC and initializes the UFCD option display windows with the clock
options: DATE, ET counter, CD timer, ZTOD, and LTOD. Border highlights indicate that an option
is enabled for data entry. If an option is displayed on the HUD, the option has *HUD displayed below
it in addition to being border highlighted. The DATE, ET, ZTOD, LTOD, and CD options are mutually
exclusive; selecting one option deselects another option.
Data entry can be made for current date, current zulu or local time, or initial countdown time. No
data entry is available for the elapsed time option.
If DATE is highlighted, an M, D, and Y appear in the scratch pad and the month, day and year can
be entered on the keypad. If LTOD or ZTOD are highlighted two colons appear in the scratchpad and
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-8 ORIGINAL
the hour, minutes and seconds can be entered on the keypad. If CD is highlighted one colon appears
in the scratchpad and minutes and seconds can be entered. Leading zeroes must be entered for the date
and time entries. Digits not entered are assumed to be zeroes, i.e., trailing zeroes need not be entered.
The time is displayed on the scratchpad as it is entered and displayed as ##:##:##. When the time
has been updated in the SDC it appears on the HUD and *HUD appears on the UFCD highlighted
option. The time display can be changed from local or zulu by selecting the appropriate option on the
UFCD and entering the appropriate time as before.
Countdown (CD) or elapsed (ET) time is selected and displayed in the same manner as local or zulu
time with the addition of START or STOP options. While CD START is displayed, the countdown
timer is counting down. The countdown timer defaults to 6 minutes on power up. If an invalid
countdown time is entered the timer sets to 59:59 and freezes. While ET START is displayed, the
elapsed timer is counting up to a maximum of 59:59.
24.1.3.15 MENU Option (HSI Format). When MENU is selected on the top level HSI display, the
TAC Menu is displayed. The Tactical (TAC) option provides access to weapons, sensors and HUD
formats. The TAC Menu is displayed when the MENU option on any format is pressed. The Support
(SUPT) menu is accessed by pressing the MENU option when the Tactical (TAC) menu is displayed.

channel changes are controlled by the ILS channel thumbwheels.
24.1.7.2 ILS Channel Thumbwheels. These thumbwheels are used to select ILS channels when the
ILS UFC/MAN switch is set to MAN.
24.2 INERTIAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM (INS)/GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS)
There are two navigation system configurations. In one configuration, navigation data is provided by
two separate systems: INS (CAINS II) and GPS (MAGR or MAGR2K). In the other configuration,
navigation data is provided by a single system called Accurate Navigation (ANAV) which integrates
the INS and GPS together. Both configurations provide data to the MC for navigation, targeting, and
weapon delivery.
Additionally, ANAV integrates the Deflection of Vertical (DoV) database (also known as the Gravity
Map database). The DoV database is downloaded onto the mission card during mission planning. The
continual use of DoV data along the flight path assists in an improved navigation solution. If GPS data
is unavailable, the additional DoV data assists the ANAV system in maintaining unaided navigation
performance.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-10 ORIGINAL
24.2.1 Inertial Navigation System (INS). The INS is a self-contained, fully automatic dead
reckoning navigation system. The INS detects aircraft motion and provides acceleration, velocity,
present position, pitch, roll, and true heading.
Without good GPS satellite data, unaided INS (POS/INS) is the primary position keeping mode. In
POS/INS, the navigation system provides data by using the INS’s sensor data alone. In this mode, the
navigation data drifts in error over time. With ANAV installed, the error drift is minimized with the
use of the DoV data. POS/INS is selected by turning the INS knob to NAV after GND or CV alignment
or is automatically defaulted to when GPS data is lost while in aided INS (POS/AINS).
If the INS is turned off with the INS knob or shuts down abnormally
(power loss), the INS knob must be set to OFF for a minimum of 20
seconds.
NOTE
While it is acceptable to taxi with the INS off, the INS should be on,
whenever possible, to reduce accelerometer wear. It is preferable to
switch to the GYRO mode and wait for course level complete (NO
ATT clears) before taxiing.
24.2.2 Global Positioning System (GPS). The GPS provides position, velocity, and time (PVT) data
that can be used to aid the INS or as an independent navigation sensor. The GPS receives modulated
signals through the GPS antenna from 32 high orbit satellites. Satellite data is used to determine GPS
position and velocity. GPS can be initialized with crypto keys, enabling encrypted Y-code (precise/
encrypted) navigation signals to be received.
With good GPS satellite data, aided INS (POS/AINS) is the primary position keeping mode. In
POS/AINS, the navigation system provides data by blending the INS sensor data with GPS data.
POS/AINS is selected by turning the INS knob to IFA after a GND or CV alignment. The position
keeping mode remains POS/AINS unless GPS data is lost, an INS or GPS failure occurs, or the pilot
manually chooses a different position keeping source.
GPS has four modes of operation which are displayed on the GPS page (see figure 24-3). In NAV
mode, the GPS tracks all available satellite constellations possible to provide the most accurate PVT
solution. In Initialize (INIT) mode, the power supply is turned on, satellite tracking is not performed,
and almanac and waypoint data are loaded from the mission card into the GPS when initiated by the
MC. In Not Ready (NOT RDY) mode, the GPS is off or not communicating on the MUX. TEST mode
is provided for ground BIT testing.
Crypto key loading may be performed with an approved crypto loading device such as KYK-13,
CYZ−10, or Simple Key Loader (SKL) in any mode of operation.
It is important to set Zulu Time of Day (ZTOD) to aid in satellite acquisition. Local time, if desired,
should be set after takeoff. GPS is loaded with GPS precise times only once per cold start. Changing
the aircraft time or date with WonW re-initializes the GPS. An overall GPS Position Accuracy Figure
Of Merit (FOM) and Satellite (SAT) status is displayed on the GPS page to enhance the pilot’s
awareness of the overall GPS status.
24.2.3 Inertial Alignment Modes. INS alignment modes which can be selected using the INS knob
are CV (carrier alignment), GND (ground alignment), IFA (in−flight alignment), and GYRO
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-11 ORIGINAL
(AHRS attitude only). A Stored Heading alignment may also be selected to reduce CV/GND alignment
time if certain conditions are met.
During the first 30 seconds to 2 minutes of all alignments, NO ATT is displayed to the right of QUAL
on the HSI alignment display and the INS ATT caution is set. After the platform has leveled, NO ATT
is replaced with a quality (QUAL) number and the INS begins to determine true north. The QUAL
number is an estimate of present position accuracy in nm/hr 95% (CAINS) or nm/hr CEP (ANAV).
The INS ATT caution clears when the QUAL number becomes less than 5. Also during the alignment,
the GPS is initialized with WYPT 0, ZTOD, DATE, almanac and GPS waypoints if the aircraft is
WonW. After initialization, the GPS is commanded to search and acquire GPS satellites. OK is
displayed next to the QUAL number when a satisfactory alignment is achieved and the INS can be
switched to IFA (POS/AINS) or NAV (POS/INS). Also during the alignment, the TIME increments.
The TIME stops incrementing and flashes when the INS suspends alignment due to premature
parking brake release (GND or CV), parking brake release and motion detected (GND, ANAV only),
GPS data unavailable (IFA), ship INS (SINS) data unavailable (CV), POS ERROR caution set (ANAV
only), or waiting for carrier data entry or carrier heading and/or carrier velocity changes during CV
Manual alignment.
NOTE
With ANAV installed, changing the INS boresight values during
alignment causes the INS to re-initialize the alignment.
24.2.3.1 CV Alignment Modes. Turning the INS knob to CV provides CV alignment options of RF
(radio frequency), CBL (cable), and MAN (manual). During a RF or CBL alignment, the aircraft is
Figure 24-3. GPS Page
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-12 ORIGINAL
data linked to the ship’s INS (SINS). The MAN option has no data link capability and alignment data
must be entered manually. Before selecting CV, WYPT 0, ZTOD and DATE should be entered and the
parking brake set. The parking brake must remain set until a satisfactory alignment is achieved (OK
displayed). If the parking brake is released before OK is displayed and the QUAL number is greater
than 5, the INS switches to GYRO mode (AHRS attitude only). A complete re−initialization is
required to achieve a satisfactory alignment (OK displayed). This can be accomplished by turning the
INS knob to OFF for 20 seconds and then selecting either IFA or CV. If the parking brake is released
before OK is displayed and the QUAL number is less than or equal to 5, the INS switches to POS/INS
with limited performance. This partial alignment can be completed by selecting IFA.
24.2.3.1.1 RF/CBL SINS Alignment. During the CV RF/CBL SINS alignment, the INS automatically compensates for the difference between the aircraft deck position and SINS position. To perform
this alignment, the parking brake must be set and the INS knob turned to CV. The navigation system
and data link are turned on and CV alignment data is displayed on the HSI (figure 24-4). For an RF
alignment, information is received by radio frequency and CV RF is displayed. The alignment
frequency is displayed on the UFCD scratchpad for 30 seconds after selecting CV and may be changed
using the UFCD keypad. When a cable is connected to the aircraft, information is received on the cable
and CV CBL is displayed. RF/CBL and the TIME flashes until the SINS data becomes valid. If the
SINS data becomes invalid during the alignment, the TIME flashes and the INS suspends the
alignment until the SINS data becomes valid again. If the SINS data remains invalid for 30 seconds,
the INS automatically switches to CV Manual alignment using the last valid SINS data the INS
received. If the SINS data becomes valid during CV Manual alignment, the INS automatically switches
back to CV SINS alignment. CV SINS alignment time is normally less than 10 minutes.
While the platform is being leveled, a total of 10 waypoints can be received. When 10 waypoints have
been received, WYPTS is displayed below the TIME. If all waypoint data is not received, NO WYPTS
is displayed below the TIME. Reception of waypoint data is not required for the alignment to proceed.
24.2.3.1.2 CV MAN (Manual) Alignment. A CV Manual alignment can be performed if the data link
signal is not available or not desired, or occurs automatically if the CV SINS data is invalid for more
than 30 seconds. CV Manual alignment requires entering CV data on the UFCD. To perform this
alignment, the parking brake must be set and the INS knob turned to CV. The navigation system and
data link are turned on and CV alignment data is displayed on the HSI. Selecting the MAN option on
the HSI enables the CV Manual alignment display on the HSI and UFCD (figure 24-4). MAN is boxed
when selected and the STD HDG option is removed. Carrier latitude/longitude data (POSN), heading
(CHDG), and speed (CVEL) are entered through the UFCD. The INS uses this data to update present
position during the alignment. If the carrier heading changes more than 10° or carrier speed changes
more than 1 knot, the aircrew must re-enter carrier data to reinitialize the alignment. In the case where
the CV SINS data was invalid for more than 30 seconds, the INS uses the last valid SINS data to
complete a CV Manual alignment. If this occurs, no carrier data entry is required. CV Manual
alignment time is approximately 15 minutes.

The parking brake must remain set until a satisfactory alignment is achieved (OK displayed). If the
parking brake is released before OK is displayed and QUAL > 5, the alignment must be restarted.
If the parking brake is released before OK is displayed and QUAL < 5, the partial alignment may be
completed by selecting IFA.

24.2.3.2 Ground (GND) Alignment. To perform a ground alignment, the parking brake must be set,
WYPT 0, ZTOD and DATE entered, and the INS knob turned to GND. The navigation system is
turned on and GRND alignment data is displayed on the HSI (figure 24-5). If the aircraft is taxied
during the alignment, the INS suspends the alignment as indicated by the TIME flashing. With ANAV
installed, the aircraft may be taxied without restarting the alignment if the QUAL number is less than
or equal to 5.
NOTE
The most accurate alignment of the INS is achieved by changing
aircraft heading at least 70° (180° optimum) after OK is displayed
next to the QUAL number and allowing the alignment to continue. An
alignment with TIME greater than 12 minutes has little to no benefit.
The MC automatically transfers WYPT 0 to the INS to be used as aircraft present position. This
information appears on the GRND alignment display. WYPT 0 position can be updated prior to
selecting GND but if an error is noticed after the alignment has begun, aircraft present position must
be corrected because WYPT 0 is transferred to the INS only once. If aircraft present position is
incorrect, it must be corrected or the INS will align improperly. Refer to Aircraft (A/C) Programming
(this chapter) to enter new aircraft position data.
CAINS Only: The INS restarts the alignment if more than one position update is performed. If the
parking brake is released at any time during the alignment, the alignment suspends. If the parking
brake is set, the alignment continues within 20 seconds if the QUAL number is less than or equal to 5
or restarts if the QUAL number is greater than 5.
ANAV Only: The INS does not restart the alignment if the position is updated with TIME less
than 30 seconds and if the update is no more than 0.4 nm from the original position. After 30 seconds,
any position update restarts the alignment. The parking brake may be released with TIME greater
than 30 seconds; however, if the INS detects aircraft motion with the parking brake released, the INS
suspends the alignment until no motion is detected for 20 seconds, at which point the alignment
continues if the QUAL number is less than or equal to 5 or restarts if the QUAL number is greater than
5.

If the aircraft takes off in GND mode before OK is displayed and the QUAL number is greater than
5, the INS switches to GYRO mode (AHRS attitude only). If the aircraft takes off in GND mode before
OK is displayed and the QUAL number is less than or equal to 5, the INS switches to POS/INS mode
with limited performance. These partial alignments can be completed by selecting IFA.
24.2.3.3 Stored Heading (STD HDG) Alignment. A Stored Heading alignment may be performed to
reduce alignment time if the INS was turned off after a good alignment, the parking brake was set at
shutdown, and no other INS mode was selected prior to turning the INS knob to OFF. The STD HDG
option is provided on the HSI CV/GND alignment display if available (figure 24−5). The STD HDG
option is removed when a GND or CV SINS alignment has progressed to the point where selecting the
STD HDG option would not reduce alignment time; or, during a CV alignment, when the MAN option
is selected.
Selecting the STD HDG option results in an alignment based on the stored heading when the INS
was turned off. To perform a Stored Heading alignment, the parking brake must be set, WYPT 0,
ZTOD, and DATE entered, the INS knob turned to CV or GND, and the STD HDG option selected.
During a Stored Heading alignment, the INS checks if the current heading is the same as the previous
alignment’s heading. If so, OK is displayed next to the QUAL number for CAINS, within 3 minutes for
a GND alignment and within 4 minutes for a CV SINS alignment; for ANAV, within 30 seconds for a
GND alignment and within 60 seconds for a CV SINS alignment. After OK is displayed, the INS knob
can be turned to IFA (POS/AINS) or NAV (POS/INS). If the aircrew allows the alignment to continue,
the QUAL number may decrease as the alignment continues normally.
If the aircrew believes that the aircraft has been moved or its shutdown heading has changed either
on the ground or with respect to the carrier deck, a Stored Heading alignment should not be attempted
even if the STD HDG option is available. If the aircraft has moved, poor performance may result if a
Stored Heading alignment is achieved.
24.2.3.4 In-Flight Alignment (IFA). An IFA may be used with WonW (IFA GPS only) or in−flight
to perform a complete alignment (e.g., INS failure) or complete a partial CV/GND alignment. With the
APG−73 Radar installed, an IFA can be performed with either magnetic heading and radar precision
velocity update (PVU) data (IFA RDR), or with GPS satellite data (IFA GPS). With the APG−79
Radar installed, an IFA can only be performed with GPS satellite data (IFA GPS). An IFA should be
considered a backup alignment mode to GND and CV alignments.
NOTE
The APG−79 Radar does not perform PVUs; therefore, radar IFA is
not possible. However, IFA RDR is displayed until good GPS satellite
data is acquired.
Present position can be provided but is not required for the alignment by performing a position
update using the UPDT option or by entering the aircraft data on the UFCD using the DATA option.
Another very good technique is to select TACAN position keeping if a stationary TACAN is available.
Velocity updates cannot be performed during an IFA. The VEL update option is displayed but is not
functional.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-17 ORIGINAL
24.2.3.4.1 IFA (APG-73). Select STBY with the ATT switch to verify the accuracy of HUD attitude
data by crosschecking the standby instruments. If POS/MIDS is the current position keeping mode,
select POS/ADC.
NOTE
If POS/MIDS is the current position keeping mode, select POS/ADC
before commencing IFA procedures.
Select NAV master mode and radar altitude to the HUD. Then turn the INS knob to OFF for 20
seconds. On the SUPT/HSI/DATA/(A/C) page, check magnetic variation, present position, and winds
aloft. To check the magnetic variation, observe the magnetic variation value on the SUPT/HSI/DATA/
(A/C) page or observe the difference between true heading and magnetic heading and compare this to
the known local magnetic variation. If aircraft data is incorrect, refer to Aircraft (A/C) Programming
(this chapter) to update.
NOTE
• Checking and correcting magnetic variation is critical. Excessive drift
error in magnetic variation causes insidious errors in aircraft heading.
This induces navigation deviations that are especially significant
during instrument departures and approaches.
• Since the magnetic variation changes as a function of the aircraft
position (latitude/longitude), the correct local magnetic variation must
be manually re-entered periodically to maintain an error−free magnetic heading. Updating the magnetic variation every 100 NM is
sufficient as long as the aircraft does not fly near or greater than 60°
North or South latitude. In these Polar Regions, magnetic variation (as
well as magnetic heading) changes significantly as a function of
aircraft position change. Flying True Heading is advisable in these
regions.
If the IFA is being performed with WonW, enter WYPT 0, ZTOD and Date. If in flight, maintain
straight and level, unaccelerated flight for 20 seconds, then turn the INS knob to IFA. The navigation
system is turned on and IFA alignment data is displayed on the HSI (figure 24-6). IFA RDR is
displayed but may immediately switch to IFA GPS with good satellite data. If IFA GPS is displayed,
complete the alignment with the IFA GPS Indicated steps. Maintain straight and level flight for at
least 30 seconds after selecting IFA. When IFA is selected, the radar may enter the PVU mode. In the
PVU mode, CONT PVU and SEA options are boxed (default selection). Verify that the proper radar
PVU mode is selected (LAND or SEA) and observe that the TIME begins to increment. During the
first 10 to 15 seconds of the alignment while the INS platform is being leveled, NO ATT is displayed
to the right of QUAL. Wait until after NO ATT clears and is replaced with the QUAL number. Then
select AUTO or INS with the ATT switch and the INS ATT caution clears when the QUAL number
becomes less than 5.0. Selecting AUTO or INS replaces standby attitude reference indicator data on
the HUD with INS attitude data. The waterline symbol is replaced with the velocity vector which may
be slowly flashing if vertical velocity is degraded. The velocity vector continues to slowly flash until
vertical velocity becomes valid (when the QUAL number is approximately 5.0). When horizontal
position becomes valid, the POS/ADC caution clears.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-18 ORIGINAL
IFA RDR Indicated -
Maintain straight and level flight for as much as practical during the alignment. If a turn must be
executed, rapidly exceed 30° AOB and return to straight and level flight as soon as possible. This
prevents the INS from aligning to a false reference by placing the alignment on hold until straight and
level flight is regained. During an IFA, air data dead reckoning is used for navigation to maintain a
current present position. When a satisfactory alignment is achieved (OK displayed), turn the INS knob
to NAV. For landing, crosscheck HUD information with the standby instruments.
Following an IFA RDR, make every attempt to maintain VMC with a
discernible horizon. Residual attitude errors may be subtle and difficult
to discern without reference to a visible horizon or the standby instruments. If velocity vector information is suspect, select STBY to the HUD.
PVU mode may be overridden by deselecting the CONT PVU option but IFA quality will be
affected. Deselecting CONT PVU alternates PVU mode with the last selected radar mode. In PVU
mode, the radar provides Doppler velocities for INS alignment. The radar look-down angles are
optimized for land or sea return by selection of the LAND or SEA option. PVU is inhibited for IFA if
the aircraft is not in the NAV master mode. If the radar is not operating or is inhibited from operating
in PVU, the TIME flashes and the CONT PVU option is not displayed.
IFA GPS Indicated -
Perform one gentle 90° S-turn (less than 20° AOB and ± 10° pitch) to facilitate the alignment. Then
maintain straight and level flight as much as practical. When a satisfactory alignment is achieved, the
IFA alignment data is removed from the HSI and the MC automatical transitions to POS/AINS
position keeping mode. GPS IFA takes approximately 10 minutes.
If good GPS satellite data is lost prior to achieving a satisfactory alignment (OK not displayed)
during a GPS IFA, the INS suspends the alignment. If good satellite data is re-acquired within 65
seconds, the INS continues to align using GPS data. If good satellite data is not re-acquired within 65
seconds, the MC attempts to complete the alignment with a radar IFA as described in IFA RDR
Indicated. If WonW, wait until good GPS satellite data is available (SAT STATUS = GOOD on the
GPS page) or turn the INS knob to OFF for 20 seconds and perform the appropriate alignment (GND
or CV). If good GPS satellite data is lost after achieving a satisfactory alignment using GPS data, the
position keeping mode defaults to POS/INS and a P/INS advisory is displayed until good GPS satellite
data is available (SAT STATUS = GOOD on the GPS page) and then the position keeping mode
automatically returns to POS/AINS and the P/INS advisory clears.

NOTE
If POS/MIDS is the current position keeping mode, select POS/ADC

knob to IFA and the navigation system is turned on and IFA alignment data is displayed on the HSI
(figure 24-6). While waiting for the GPS to acquire good GPS satellite data, IFA RDR is displayed, the
TIME flashes, and the INS suspends the alignment. Once good GPS satellite data is acquired, IFA
GPS is displayed and the alignment begins. During the first 10 to 15 seconds of the alignment while the
INS platform is being leveled, NO ATT is displayed to the right of QUAL. Maintain straight and level,
unaccelerated flight to level the INS and clear the NO ATT indication. NO ATT is replaced with the
QUAL number. Then select AUTO or INS with the ATT switch and the INS ATT caution clears when
the QUAL number becomes less than 5.0. Selecting AUTO or INS replaces standby attitude reference
indicator data on the HUD with INS attitude data. The waterline symbol is replaced with the velocity
vector which may be slowly flashing if vertical velocity is degraded. The velocity vector continues to
slowly flash until vertical velocity becomes valid. When the GPS horizontal position becomes valid, the
POS/ADC caution clears. Perform one gentle 90° S-turn (less than 20° AOB and ±10° pitch) to
facilitate the alignment. Then maintain straight and level flight as much as practical. When a
satisfactory alignment is achieved, the IFA alignment data is removed from the HSI and the MC
automatically transitions to POS/AINS position keeping mode. IFA takes approximately 10 minutes.
This time can be greatly reduced by performing the S-turn.
An IFA may be used to complete a partial CV/GND alignment. At takeoff with a partial alignment,
the INS platform should already be leveled (NO ATT replaced with a QUAL number). Select IFA and
the position keeping mode automatically transitions to POS/AINS once a satisfactory alignment has
been achieved. Completing a partial alignment with an IFA may occur very quickly.
If good GPS satellite data is lost prior to achieving a satisfactory alignment (OK not displayed), the

24.2.3.5 Gyro Recovery. A gyro recovery is actually an AHRS attitude only INS in which reliable
INS attitude data is recovered. With CAINS installed, the GPS may already be operating. With ANAV
installed, if the GPS is functional, the GPS initializes and acquires satellites. Select AUTO or INS with
the ATT switch and maintain straight and level, unaccelerated flight. Turn the INS knob to OFF for
20 seconds prior to selecting GYRO. The INS ATT caution does not clear and standby attitude
reference indicator data on the HUD remains until GPS velocity data is valid if operational. If takeoff
occurs with a partial alignment, GYRO mode is available.
24.2.4 Navigation System BIT.
24.2.4.1 CAINS and GPS. The INS and GPS uses start-up, periodic and initiated built−in test
(BIT). Start-up BIT is performed when power is applied to the INS or GPS. Periodic BIT monitors
essential parameters within the system and provides in-flight, shipboard, and ground failure detection
and isolation. Initiated BIT is performed on the ground and accomplishes that portion of the failure
detection and isolation capability which periodic BIT is unable to do. Initiated BIT can be performed
by selecting the INS (with the INS knob in TEST) or the GPS option on the NAV sublevel of the BIT
page. BIT status is displayed on the BIT page next to the INS and GPS legends.
24.2.4.2 ANAV. The ANAV (INS and GPS) uses start-up, periodic and initiated built-in test (BIT).
Start-up BIT is performed when power is applied to the ANAV. Periodic BIT monitors essential
parameters within the system and provides in-flight, shipboard, and ground failure detection and
isolation. Initiated BIT is performed on the ground and accomplishes that portion of the failure
detection and isolation capability which periodic BIT is unable to do. Initiated ANAV BIT can be
performed by turning the INS knob to TEST and selecting the INS/GPS option on the NAV sublevel
of the BIT page. If Initiated BIT is performed prior to the completion of Start-up BIT and the INS and
GPS are functioning properly, the GPS reports PBIT GO. If Initiated BIT is performed after the
completion of Start-up BIT and the INS and GPS are functioning properly, the GPS reports GO. BIT
status is displayed on the BIT page next to the INS and GPS legends.
24.2.5 NAVCK Display. The NAVCK page allows analysis of INS/GPS/FCC air data function
reliability (figure 24-7). The page is displayed by selecting the NAV CK option on the HSI A/C DATA
page. The velocity check more readily indicates vertical or horizontal velocity discrepancy problems.
INS, GPS and FCC air data function velocities are periodically compared and when an excessive
disagreement is sensed, the NAV VVEL, NAV HVEL cautions or VVEL advisory (CAINS only) are
set.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-23 ORIGINAL
The top portion of the page consists of INS, GPS and FCC air data function (ADC) velocities. The
bottom portion consists of wind velocities, best available MC groundspeed (if valid) and best available
MC true airspeed (if not zero). INS, GPS and ADC velocity components are displayed even if invalid.
If INS, GPS or ADC data is invalid, a # is displayed to the right of the invalid data along with #
INVALID at the bottom of the page. If wind velocity is estimated, an * (asterisk) is displayed to the
right of the wind velocity components along with *EST at the bottom of the page.
24.2.6 GPS Page. The GPS page displays current GPS status (figure 24-3). The page is displayed by
selecting the GPS option on the SUPT MENU.
The GPS operating mode is displayed at the top of the page (GPS − XXXX) with possible modes
of NAV, INIT, NOT RDY, or TEST (see 24.2.2 for a description of operating modes). When the GPS
is not in TEST, the NAV and INIT options are available. The use of these two options is not
recommended.
The GPS Figure of Merit (FOM) is an indication of the estimated GPS position accuracy with a
value from 1 to 9, with 1 being the best and 9 the worst. The following table shows the corresponding
estimated accuracy.
FOM Value Expected Position Error* (Meters)

The SAT STATUS is an indication of satellite signal integrity. Possible indications are GOOD,
MARGINAL, and JAMMED. An overall State 5 indicates GOOD, State 3 indicates MARGINAL, and
if not in State 5 and not in State 3, JAMMED is indicated.
The GPS current position is displayed along with the GPS’s Horizontal and Vertical Estimated
Errors (HERR and VERR) in feet and GPS TIME.
Up to 4 individual satellite channel states are displayed. If the number of satellites in State 5 are
greater than or equal to 4, all 4 positions indicate State 5. If less than 4 satellites are indicating State
5, the corresponding number of positions indicate State 5 and the remaining positions indicate State
3 or are blank.
The bottom of the page displays the crypto key status. Up to seven crypto key status messages can
be displayed. Three of the status messages are mutually exclusive: VERIFIED, UNVERIFIED, and
INCORRECT. The other six messages are displayed when reported by the GPS: GUV USER (group
unique variables), KEY FAIL (key failed parity), INSUFF KEY (insufficient keys), ERASE FAIL
(erase failure), 2 HR ALERT (2 hour alert), and VALID ENTRY (receiver contains keys).
24.2.7 INS Knob. The INS knob is located on the right hand console SNSR panel and has positions
of OFF, CV, GND, NAV, IFA, GYRO, GB, and TEST.
OFF Removes power from INS. With ANAV installed, removes power from the INS and GPS.
CV Commands the INS carrier alignment mode. With ANAV installed, GPS initializes and acquires
satellites.
GND Commands the INS ground alignment mode. With ANAV installed, GPS initializes and acquires
satellites.
NAV Commands the INS to unaided navigation mode (POS/INS) which enables the MC to use unaided INS or GPS data to provide navigation steering.
IFA Commands the INS in-flight alignment mode. Also commands the INS into aided navigation
mode (POS/AINS) after a satisfactory alignment is achieved.
GYRO Commands the AHRS mode. With ANAV, GPS initializes and acquires satellites.
GB Commands the INS to CV or GND alignment mode indefinitely. With ANAV installed, GPS initializes and acquires satellites.
TEST Enables the INS to perform an initiated BIT upon command from the MC. With ANAV installed, enables the INS and GPS to perform an initiated BIT upon command from the MC.

24.2.9 Waypoints, Offset Aimpoints (OAP), and Offsets. A waypoint is a geographical point for
which latitude, longitude, and elevation are stored in the MC. An OAP is a waypoint which has an
offset associated with it. An offset is a point defined by bearing and range from the OAP along with
elevation of the point (offset).
Mission data such as waypoints and offsets may be entered using the Data Transfer Equipment
(DTE) and the mission initialization display or manually.
24.2.9.1 Waypoint/Offset Aimpoint Programming. Waypoint/OAP data is entered by selecting the
DATA option on the waypoint data top level display. The waypoint data display is automatically
initialized with WYPT boxed. This display shows the current waypoint/OAP data: waypoint lat/long
position, UTM Grid coordinates, and elevation; offset range, GRID, bearing, and elevation (if
applicable). Waypoint/OAP data is entered by selecting an up/down arrow to select the desired
waypoint/OAP and the UFC option to initialize the UFCD for waypoint/OAP data entry. On the
UFCD the following selections complete the selection: POSN option to enter lat/long data, ELEV
option to enter elevation data, and O/S option to enter offset data (offset range, bearing, UTM grid
coordinates and elevation). Offset data is in relation to the offset aimpoint. Waypoint/OAP data is
entered through the UFCD keypad, with a maximum of 60 waypoints (0 to 59) available for
programming. See figure 24-9, sheets 1 and 2.
Waypoint data can also be entered using the map slew method by selecting WYPT on the DATA
option display, and actuating the SLEW button. Pressing the TDC and slewing the map to the desired
lat/long position under the waypoint symbol locates the point.
NOTE
Lat/long and elevation data on the MPCD reflect the current map
position under the waypoint symbol as the map is being slewed.
Upon release of the TDC the current waypoint data is entered for the map position under the
waypoint symbol. Selecting the next waypoint number as required (using the waypoint increment/
decrement option buttons) allows further waypoint data entry.
Another map slew method is to select WYPT on the DATA option display, actuating the SLEW
button, and pressing and holding the TDC to slew the map to the desired lat/long position under the
waypoint symbol. This position is entered by selecting another waypoint (using the waypoint
increment/decrement option buttons). Continuing to hold the TDC, the map is slewed as required, and
the next waypoint is selected for further waypoint data entry.
Offset aimpoints may also be entered using the map slew method; however, the associated offset
must be entered through the UFCD.
24.2.9.1.1 GPS Waypoint Programming. Aircraft with GPS can utilize the GPS to store up to 200
waypoints. GPS points are loaded into the GPS from the memory unit. GPS points can be displayed
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-26 ORIGINAL
and/or transferred into the MC waypoint data base using the HSI/DATA/GPS display. A GPS point
can be transferred into any MC waypoint by pressing the XFER option on the GPS display. When GPS
option is selected the first 24 GPS points are displayed in alphanumeric order. Selection of points to
load is accomplished by the right and down arrows and page selection arrows. Repeated selection of
these arrows causes the cursor to wrap around. It may take as long as 3 seconds to retrieve selected
position data and display it on the GPS display. See figure 24-8. GPS waypoints are transferred to the
MC by selecting the desired waypoint number with the up/down arrows on the HSI/DATA/GPS
sublevel, moving the cursor down/right and/or page up/down to the desired waypoint ID code, and
pressing XFER. The GPS LAT/LONG, GPS altitude, and current ID code displays are blanked and
the XFER option is removed. The selected ID code is displayed in the ‘‘Current ID’’ position indicating
that waypoint is requested. After approximately 3 seconds, the requested GPS LAT/LONG and GPS
altitude is displayed and the XFER option is returned for transfer selection. If a GPS ID code is
requested and is not available, the selected ID code is displayed with a line through it. Once a GPS
waypoint has been transferred from the GPS to the MC it becomes an MC waypoint. The waypoint ID
code is retained and is displayed on the top level HSI and HSI/DATA/WYPT formats when the
waypoint is selected as the current waypoint.
24.2.9.1.2 UTM Data Entry. Data for all waypoints and OAPs may be entered as universal transverse
mercator (UTM) coordinates. See figure 24-9. UTM grid coordinates are defined by a spheroid, grid
zone designation, square identification, and easting/northing. Grid zone designation divides the world
area between N84° and S80° into 100 km squares. At power up with WonW the MC initializes
Figure 24-8. GPS Waypoint Display

waypoint elevation, O/S range and elevation, and TACAN elevation in FEET, and O/S bearing to
TRUE. UTM data for waypoints are entered by performing the following:
1. Select DATA/WYPT on the HSI top level display.
2. Select the desired spheroid by selecting the spheroid option.
3. Select UFC on the HSI. The first cockpit to select UFC has control of grid data entry and has the
GRID display on the RDDI.
4. Select GRID on the UFCD. The MC determines the grid zone designation and 100 km square ID
of the reference position and constructs a five by five Square Identification Grid (SIG) centered
about the reference position and displayed on the RDDI. Reference position is either the A/C
present position or the referenced waypoint position (REF WP Boxed).
5. Slew the acquisition cursor into the desired square, depress and release the TDC.
6. On the UFCD enter the six digit easting/northing and press ENT. Leading zeros must be input
for easting/northing. The UTM coordinates are displayed on the HSI under the lat/long provided
the latitude is within the N84° to S80° limits.
UTM data for O/S are entered by performing the following:
7. Select DATA/WYPT on the HSI top level display.
8. Select UFC on the HSI.
9. Select O/S on the UFCD.
10. Select Grid on the UFCD.
11. Slew the HOTAS cursor into the desired square, depress and release the TDC.
12. Enter O/S easting/northing in the UFCD.
The MC converts the UTM Grid coordinates to latitude/ longitude and then to range and bearing.
O/S coordinates more than 400,000 feet from the OAP cause the UTM coordinates to flash in the O/S
grid field on the HSI. The UTM coordinate is displayed in the O/S field on the HSI.
SIG square blanking must be checked any time the SIG is built. If the latitude is out of UTM range
(above N84°or below S80°) the entire row is blanked. At certain latitudes, due to the convergence of
the earth, individual squares are blank.
Grid shift options are provided to view and select grid squares in the eight adjacent grid squares
whenever the A/C or Waypoint symbol is in the center square of the SIG and the adjacent SIGs exist.
See figure 24-9. N, S, E, W, SE, SW, NE, or NW can be selected by pressing the grid shift options on
the HSI, or by pressing and releasing the TDC when the HOTAS cursor is over a grid shift push button
legend. The MC determines a new center position about which to construct a new SIG. Selecting the
A/C or waypoint symbol returns the SIG to the original position.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-28 ORIGINAL
Units can be input as FEET or MTRS for elevation; FEET, MTRS, NM, or YARD for range. The
MC tests that all bearing, range and elevation data input through the UFCD are in the valid range.
Unit Valid Range
Easting/Northing

0 - 400,000 FT
0 - 122,000 MTRS
0 - 66 NM
0 - 133,000 YDS
When data is outside the valid range, the MC causes the word ERROR to flash in the UFCD
scratchpad and requires the data to be reinput.
24.2.9.2 TGT (Target) Programming. A target must be entered in a waypoint/OAP sequence so the
MC can calculate the groundspeed required to arrive on target at the appropriate time. Only one
waypoint/OAP can be designated as a target for all three sequences. A waypoint/OAP is identified as
a target on the waypoint data sublevel display by an inverted triangle above the waypoint/OAP number
in the waypoint/OAP sequence. At power up with WonW the previous target waypoint/OAP is cleared.
A waypoint/OAP as a target in a waypoint/OAP sequence is designated the DATA option on the
MPCD top level display, the SEQUFC option on the waypoint data sublevel display to initialize the
UFCD, and the TGT option on the UFCD. Waypoint/OAP number is entered on the UFCD keypad
and the ENT option selected. The target waypoint/OAP is undesignated by either entering the target
waypoint/OAP a second time or entering an invalid waypoint/OAP. See figure 24-9.
24.2.9.3 TOT (Time On Target) Programming. TOT pertains to the programmed target waypoint/
OAP, and is relative to the programmed ZTOD (zulu time of day). ZTOD must be programmed before
TOT can be entered. TOT is programmed from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59 and is displayed on the waypoint
data sublevel display.
TOT is entered by selecting the DATA option on the MPCD top level display, selecting the
SEQUFC option on the waypoint data sublevel display to initialize the UFCD, selecting the TOT
option on the UFCD, entering the desired TOT value on the UFCD keypad, and selecting the ENT
option. See figure 24-9.
24.2.9.4 Groundspeed Programming. Groundspeed pertains to the desired groundspeed for the
final leg to the target waypoint in the sequence. Groundspeed values up to 999 knots may be entered.
Groundspeed is entered by selecting the DATA option on the HSI top level display, selecting the
SEQUFC option on the waypoint data sublevel display to initialize the UFCD, selecting the GSPD
option on the UFCD, entering the desired GSPD value on the UFCD keypad, and selecting the ENT
option. See figure 24-9.
24.2.9.5 Waypoint/OAP Sequence Programming. A total of three waypoint/OAP sequences are
available for waypoint/OAP sequence programming and a maximum of eight waypoint/OAPs may be
programmed in each sequence. These sequences are used for AUTO sequential steering and time on
target groundspeed cuing.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-29 ORIGINAL
The waypoint data sublevel display on the HSI display must be used with the UFCD to allow the
pilot to program a waypoint/OAP sequence. The SEQ # option on the lower right corner of the display
indicates the waypoint/OAP sequence in use and initializes to the sequence selected on the HSI top
level display. This option selects the sequence to be programmed (SEQ1, SEQ2, SEQ3, or SEQL).
Selecting the SEQUFC option, on the lower left corner of the display, initializes the UFCD for
waypoint sequence programming. A waypoint/OAP cannot appear more than once in sequence but a
waypoint/OAP may be entered in more than one sequence. Mark points cannot be programmed in a
sequence. Each waypoint/OAP entered is placed to the right of the last waypoint/OAP in the sequence.
If 15 waypoints/OAPs are programmed, the first waypoint in that sequence is deleted and the
remaining waypoints/OAPs move to the left one space. Data for the current waypoint/OAP inserted/
deleted in the sequence is provided on the waypoint data level display.
A new waypoint/OAP sequence is programmed by selecting:
1. The waypoint data sublevel display using the DATA option
2. The desired sequence route number using the SEQ # option
3. The SEQUFC option to initialize the UFCD for sequence programming
4. The INSERT option on the UFCD
5. The desired waypoint/OAP number via the UFCD keypad
6. The ENT option on the UFCD keypad.
Repeat steps 4 through 6 for each waypoint/OAP in the sequence. See figure 24-9.
Waypoints/OAP are inserted into an existing sequence by selecting:
1. The waypoint data sublevel display using the DATA option
2. The desired sequence route number using the SEQ # option
3. The SEQUFC option to initialize the UFCD for programming
4. The INSERT option on the UFCD
5. The number of the waypoint/OAP to the left of the desired insertion point via UFCD keypad
6. The ENT option on the UFCD keypad
7. Number of the waypoint/OAP to be inserted via the UFCD keypad
8. The ENT option via the UFCD keypad
Waypoints are deleted from a sequence by selecting:
1. The waypoint data sublevel display using the DATA option, the desired sequence route number
using the SEQ # option
2. The SEQUFC option to initialize the UFCD for programming

24.2.10 Aircraft (A/C) Programming. Aircraft data is entered by selecting the DATA option on the
HSI top level display and the A/C option on the waypoint data sublevel display to bring up the A/C
data sublevel display. This display shows the current aircraft data: latitude/longitude position, wind
speed, wind direction, magnetic variation, and magnetic/true heading selection. Aircraft data is
entered by selecting the UFC option to initialize the UFCD keypad for aircraft data entry, selecting the
LATLN DCML or SEC option and then POSN option to enter lat/long data, the WSPD option to enter
wind speed data, the WDIR option to enter wind direction, and MVAR to enter magnetic variation
(degrees/minutes beginning with E or W).
NOTE
Entering a MVAR value without selecting the MVAR option will result
in changing the aircraft position and may result in large INS position
keeping errors.
24.2.10.1 Latitude/Longitude Display/Entry. With MC OFP H2E+ AND UP, latitude and longitude are displayed either as Degrees/ Minutes/ Ten Thousandths of minutes (LATLN DCML) or
Degrees/Minutes/Seconds/Hundredths of seconds (LATLN SEC). Actuating the LATLN XXXX
option toggles between the selection of LATLN DCML and LATLN SEC. The selected LATLN format
is reflected on all displays and UFCD formats throughout the cockpit. DCML is the cold start default.
24.2.10.1A True/Magnetic Heading Selection. Heading indications that appear on the HUD and
HSI display can be referenced to either true north or magnetic north. The capability to select a true
north heading is useful in extreme northern operations. With true north heading selected, the HSI
display, A/A and A/G radar displays, Link 4 display, and the HUD all are referenced to true north. The
true north indication on the HUD is a T displayed below the current heading. True north indications
on the HSI display consist of TRUE displayed below the current heading readout and a T displayed
below the lubber line. The true heading indications on the HSI display also appear on the Link 4
display. No indications of true north selection appear on the A/A or A/G radar display. Since aircraft
magnetic variation is used as the best available magnetic variation source, the heading reference should
not be changed when navigating a selected course.
With true heading selected, TACAN symbology is also referenced to true north if the TACAN
station is in the TACAN data table. If the TACAN station is not in the TACAN data table, magnetic
heading is used. There is no indication when magnetic heading is selected. When INS true heading
becomes invalid, magnetic heading is used. If MC1 fails, heading selection is not available. At power up
with WonW the system initializes with magnetic heading selected. The reference heading is selected by
selecting DATA on the HSI display and the A/C option to access the A/C data sublevel display.
Actuating the HDG XXX option toggles between the selection of HDG TRUE and HDG MAG.
24.2.10.2 Barometric (BARO)/Radar Low Altitude Warning Programming. The BARO/RADAR
altitude warning can be set up to a maximum of 25,000 feet for BARO and 5,000 feet for RADAR.
Setting the RADAR at a value greater than 5,000 feet results in 5,000 feet being used. Passing through
the BARO/RADAR programmed altitude from above results in the ALTITUDE voice alert. Setting
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-35 ORIGINAL
the BARO/RADAR altitude warning to 0 feet disables this function. At power up with WonW, RADAR
altitude warning initializes to 0 feet and BARO altitude warning initializes to 5,000 feet. With MC OFP
H3E AND UP, at power up with WonW, RADAR altitude warning initializes to 5,000 feet and BARO
altitude warning initializes to 10,000 feet.
Set the BARO/RADAR low altitude warning function by selecting the DATA option on the HSI top
level MPCD display selecting the A/C option to bring up the A/C data sublevel display. The
BARO/RADAR altitude functions are located on the lower left corner of the display. Selecting BARO
or RADAR initializes the UFCD for altitude entry. Selecting the desired option on the UFCD and
entering the desired altitude through the UFCD keypad and pressing ENT. The entered altitude
appears on the A/C data sublevel display below BARO/ RADAR as appropriate. See figure 24-9, sheet
3.
24.2.10.3 Zulu Time of Day (ZTOD). The FIRAMS Real Time Clock (RTC) is used to keep ZTOD.
The only time ZTOD needs to be set is if the FIRAMS RTC failed power up BIT. In this case the MC
internal counter would be used and requires the MC internal clock to be set. ZTOD is displayed on the
HUD and HSI display and is needed to calculate MC required groundspeed and TOT.
Enter ZTOD by selecting the TIMEUFC option on the HSI top level display to initialize the UFCD
for ZTOD programming. Then select the ZTOD option on the UFCD, enter ZTOD on the UFCD
keypad, and select the ENT option. At first selection of ZTOD, it is displayed on the HUD and HSI
display. ZTOD is displayed on the lower left corner of the HUD and HSI display. If time is displayed
on the HUD, the respective option has ″*HUD″ displayed below it. ZTOD is not displayed on the HUD
when either the ET or CD is selected for display. See figure 24-9, sheet 4.
24.2.10.4 Elapsed Time (ET). ET starts incrementing in minutes and seconds from 00:00 to 59:59.
When 59:59 is reached ET resets and begins incrementing again from 00:00. ET is displayed on the
lower left corner of the HUD and on the lower right corner of the HSI display. ET is not displayed on
the HUD or HSI display when either ZTOD, LTOD or CD is selected.
Activate ET by selecting the TIMEUFC option on the HSI top level display initializes the UFCD for
ET selection. Selecting the ET option on the UFCD displays ET 00:00 on the HUD and HSI display.
See figure 24-9, sheet 4.
24.2.10.5 Countdown Time (CD). CD starts decrementing in minutes and seconds from a default
value of 06:00. When 00:00 is reached, the CD timer is removed from the HUD and HSI displays. CD
is displayed on the lower left corner of the HUD and on the lower right corner of the MPCD. CD is not
displayed on the HUD or HSI when either ZTOD, LTOD or ET selected. The CD timer initializes to
the default value at power up with WonW.
Activate CD by selecting the TIMEUFC option on the MPCD top level display to initialize the
UFCD for CD selection. Selecting the CD option on the UFCD displays CD 06:00 on the HUD and HSI
display. See figure 24-9, sheet 4.
The CD default value can also be reset by entering in a value between 00:00 and 59:59 by selecting
the TIMEUFC option on the HSI top level display to initialize the UFCD for CD programming,
entering in the reset value through the UFCD keypad, and pressing the ENT option. The reset value
must be less than or equal to 59:59 so that when the ENT option is pressed the CD timer begins to
decrement. If the reset value is greater than 59:59, selection of the ENT option sets the reset value to
59:59 and freezes the CD timer.

See figure 24-9.
24.2.10.8 Time Zone. The time zone is set by first entering ZTOD followed by LTOD. The MC uses
the difference between these values as the current time zone. Any future changes to ZTOD
automatically changes LTOD based on the current time zone. Any future changes to LTOD resets the
time zone.
24.2.11 Position Keeping. Selection of the POS/XXX option on the MPCD top display provides the
position keeping option display, see figure 24-10. This display allows in-flight selection of POS/AINS,
POS/ADC, POS/GPS, POS/INS, POS/MIDS (if installed), or POS/TCN as the position keeping
source. Selecting one of these options returns the MPCD top level display with the appropriate position
keeping source selected. INS position keeping is automatically selected during ground operations when
INS data is valid. Should the INS fail, the mission computer automatically begins FCC air data
position keeping from the last valid INS position; however, it is unreliable.
AINS and GPS position keeping are not available unless good GPS data is available. GPS data is
good when the GPS vertical error (GPS VERR) and GPS estimated horizontal error (GPS HERR), as
shown on the aircraft data format, are each less than 100 feet. AINS position keeping is selected by
placing the INS mode switch in the IFA position. Automatic position keeping reversion with a
hierarchy of AINS, INS, GPS , MIDS (if installed) and FCC air data is provided in case of an INS
and/or GPS failure. TACAN position keeping provides distance data from one of the previously stored
Figure 24-10. Position Keeping

TACAN stations. The desired TACAN station is selected on the UFCD. See TACAN position keeping
this section.
MIDS Precise Participant Location and Identification (PPLI) altitude
shall not be used as an altitude reference for determining safe separation
of aircraft or terrain avoidance.
MIDS position keeping is the default position keeping mode if GPS and
INS are not available. Because MIDS alone is unreliable as a position
keeping source, POS/ADC should be selected if INS and GPS fail or
become unreliable as position keeping sources. Aircrew is unable to enter
data parameters required for an INS or radar IFA if POS/MIDS is the
position keeping source.
24.2.12 Position Updating. Selecting the UPDT (update) option on the MPCD top level display
provides the update sublevel display, see figure 24-11. This display allows in-flight selection of VEL
(velocity), TCN (TACAN), GPS, DSG (designate), AUTO (automatic), and MAP as the update
options. These options provide position/velocity updating to the INS/ADC during NAV or IFA modes.
All updates must be performed while in the NAV or A/G master modes, unless noted otherwise. TCN
position updating is described in the TACAN section, and VEL updating is described in A1-F18EATAC-Series.
NOTE
The update option is not available in AINS position keeping.
After an update is performed, the CANCEL option is displayed on the HSI UPDATE option display.
Pressing the CANCEL option cancels the previous update and removes the CANCEL option. The INS
updates the aircraft position using the last accepted position update. The CANCEL option is also
removed on touchdown or when present position is changed using the UFCD.
24.2.12.1 Designation (DSG) Update. A designation update is performed by pressing the UPDT
option on the MPCD top level display. Selecting the DSG option on the UPDT sublevel display.
Designating a waypoint/OAP with a sensor (radar, FLIR, NFLR or LDT), a HUD designation, or an
overfly designation. The DSG option may be selected before or after waypoint designation. When the
designation has been performed and DSG option selected, sensor ranging components to the target are
added to the previously entered waypoint position to give an aircraft computed position. The
difference between the computed aircraft position and the onboard aircraft position produces the
position error readout in bearing and range on the ACPT/REJ display. Selecting the ACPT option
accepts the position update and returns the MPCD top level display. Selecting the REJ option rejects
the update and returns the MPCD top display. A DSG update may be performed in the A/A master
mode if the designation was performed in A/G prior to entering A/A. The selection of UPDT/DSG
suspends auto sequential steering and disengages coupled steering.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-38 ORIGINAL
24.2.12.2 Post-flight Update. The INS post-flight update collects terminal INS maintenance data.
The post flight update is performed using the overfly designation update method. The INS determines
the overfly designation update is a post flight update using the WonW transition. The aircraft must be
completely stopped and the parking brake engaged to prevent erroneous terminal velocity data. The
post flight update is not performed onboard ship.
The INS post flight update may be performed when the parking brake is set and the aircraft is
within 600 feet of the appropriate waypoint entered in the system (the update waypoint need not be
waypoint 0). If the waypoint position is known but not programmed in the system, the position may be
entered and used for the update. If no waypoints are available, no update should be attempted.
24.2.12.3 MAP Update. A MAP update is performed by selecting the UPDT option on the MPCD
top level display, designating a waypoint/OAP with a sensor (radar, FLIR or LDT), a HUD designation
or an overfly designation and selecting the MAP option on the update sublevel display. When this is
done the word SLEW appears in the upper right corner of the MPCD and the TDC is automatically
assigned to the MPCD (for map slewing). The map can now be slewed so the target on the map is under
the designation symbol (diamond). The difference between the target position and the designated
position produces the position error readout in bearing and range on the ACPT/REJ display. Selecting
the ACPT option accepts the position update and returns the MPCD top level display. Selecting the
REJ option rejects the position update and returns the MPCD top level display. The MAP option is
not available if a map is not installed.
24.2.12.4 AUTO Update. An AUTO update is performed by selecting the UPDT option on the
MPCD top level display and selecting the AUTO option on the UPDT sublevel display. When this is
done the AUTO option is boxed and the VEL, TCN, DSG and MAP options are removed. The pilot
must assign the TDC to the MPCD, overfly the waypoint/OAP and press the TDC while over the
waypoint/OAP. The MC enters the waypoint/OAP as the aircraft present position and the MPCD top
level display is returned. The next waypoint in succession becomes designated or, in the case of an
OAP, the offset becomes designated. There is no ACPT/REJ display in the AUTO update mode.
24.2.13 NAV/TAC Bank Limit Options. Bank angle control 1 (BAC1) is engaged when any coupled
steering mode is engaged. BAC1 provides aircraft steering commands and limits; and maintains the
aircraft on course to the selected waypoint(s), offset aim point(s), or TACAN station. BAC1 also
provides steering to capture and hold a course line through the current WYPT, OAP, or TACAN
station. The maximum bank limit (BLIM) is selectable on the A/C data display. TAC BLIM is used for
tactical missions and limits the bank angle between ±30° and ±60° with a bank rate between 10° and
30° per second based on airspeed. NAV BLIM is used for general navigation and sets bank angle to a
fixed ±30° limit with a maximum bank angle rate of 10° per second.
24.2.14 Steering. Types of waypoint/OAP steering described include direct great circle, course line,
auto sequential, and target.
24.2.14.1 Waypoint/OAP Direct Great Circle Steering. Direct great circle steering is available in all
master modes and is selected/deselected by actuating the WYPT/OAP option on the MPCD. Selecting
waypoint/OAP steering deselects ILS, D/L, and TACAN steering. When steering is selected, the option
is boxed and direct great circle steering is provided on the HUD as shown in figure 24-12. To follow a
direct great circle path to the waypoint/OAP, the aircraft is turned so that the command heading
steering pointer under the heading scale is centered in the heading caret. The steering provided by the
steering pointer is corrected for wind drift. When the steering pointer is within ±5° of the caret as
measured on the heading scale, it provides a direct indication of steering error. Between ±5° and the
ends of the heading scale (±15°), the steering pointer moves nonlinearly so that it is at the end of the
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-39 ORIGINAL
Figure 24-11. Position Updating Displays
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-40 ORIGINAL
heading scale when the steering error is 30°. The steering pointer is displayed at the end of the heading
scale when the steering error is greater than 30°, the steering pointer begins to move to provide
anticipation for rolling out of the turn, and the actual steering error is indicated when within 5°.
Waypoint/OAP range, identification, and number are displayed on the lower right side of the HUD.
On the MPCD, the position of the waypoint/OAP is indicated by the waypoint/OAP symbol as
shown on figure 24-12. If the selected steer to point is an OAP, the position of the offset is indicated
by the offset symbol. Bearing to the waypoint/OAP is indicated by the pointer inside the compass rose.
The waypoint/OAP symbol and pointer are displayed whether or not direct great circle steering is
selected. They provide a navigation situation display only. Steering (corrected for drift) is provided
only on the HUD. A digital readout of bearing and range to the waypoint/OAP is provided on the upper
right corner of the MPCD. Time to go to the waypoint/OAP in minutes and seconds, based on range
and groundspeed, is provided under the bearing and range readout.
24.2.14.2 Waypoint/OAP Course Line Steering. Course line steering is used when it is desired to fly
a selected course to the waypoint/OAP. Course line steering is selected by selecting direct great circle
steering and actuating the course select switch. When the course select switch is actuated, the course
line appears through the waypoint/OAP symbol as shown in figure 24-13, sheet 1. The course line
rotates clockwise while the course select switch is held to the right and counterclockwise while it is held
to the left. A digital readout of the selected course is provided in the lower right corner of the MPCD.
When the waypoint/OAP symbol is beyond the range of the selected MPCD scale, the waypoint/OAP
symbol is limited at the inside of the compass rose coincident with the head of the pointer and the
course line rotates about the head of the pointer. It does not then overfly its correct position on the
map; but, does correctly indicate to which side of the aircraft the course lies, and the intercept angle
is correctly represented.
When a course line is selected, steering on the HUD is displayed. The arrow provides a horizontal
situation indication relative to the velocity vector. As shown, the aircraft is to the right of the selected
course, but is converging toward it. Two dots are displayed on the side of the velocity vector toward the
steering arrow and in a line perpendicular to it. The outermost dot represents full scale deflection of
the arrow (8°) and the innermost dot indicates half scale deflection (4°). If the arrow moves to the other
side of the velocity vector, the dots appear on that side. The dots are not displayed when within
approximately 1.25° of being on course. Figure 24-13, sheet 2 shows an example of the HUD steering
arrow display as the aircraft crosses a course line. The HUD situation arrow display is available only
in NAV master mode, although waypoint/OAP steering can be selected and the course arrow can be
displayed and used on the MPCD in any master mode. Only waypoint/OAP direct great circle steering
is available on the HUD when designated. Course line steering can be deselected either by deselecting
waypoint/OAP direct great circle steering or by selecting a new waypoint/OAP, initializing direct great
circle steering.
24.2.14.3 Coupled Waypoint / OAP Steering. When waypoint steering is coupled, CPL WYPT is
displayed on the HUD and HSI display, and a CPLD advisory appears on the DDI. The aircraft steers
to intercept the desired course line, or flies to the point if no course line is selected. Bank angle is
limited by NAV or TAC bank limit option as selected on the A/C sublevel display and described in
chapter 2. As the aircraft gets close to the desired course, the bank angle is reduced to maintain the
aircraft on the desired course. If course line steering is not selected, when the aircraft reaches the
waypoint or offset aim point (OAP) WYPT steering uncouples and reverts to HDG hold. If course line
steering is selected, the aircraft remains coupled and flies an outbound radial. RALT or BALT,
whichever is selected, remains engaged when the aircraft passes the waypoint. If a ground point is
designated, WYPT steering does not couple, or uncouples if previously coupled. If waypoint steering

does not engage or disengages without being commanded, an AUTOPILOT caution is displayed on the
DDI, and CPL WYPT flashes for 10 seconds on the HUD and HSI displays. The caution can be cleared
with the paddle switch.
24.2.14.4 AUTO Sequential Steering. Before AUTO sequential steering can be selected a waypoint/
OAP sequence must be programmed.
AUTO sequential steering is selected by actuating the AUTO option (AUTO boxed) on the MPCD.
When selected, other steering modes not compatible with AUTO sequential are deselected.
With AUTO sequential steering engaged, great circle steering is provided to the first waypoint/OAP
in the selected sequence, see figure 24-14. When range to the steer to waypoint/OAP is less than 5 NM
and bearing is greater than 90°, the next waypoint/OAP in the sequence is automatically selected.
Great circle steering is automatically provided for each new steer to waypoint/OAP in the sequence.
During AUTO sequential steering course line steering is available but course line is deselected when
the steer to waypoint/OAP is within the range and bearing mentioned above. The waypoint/OAP
up/down arrows provide manual selection for steering to the desired waypoint/OAP in the sequence.
With AUTO sequential steering engaged, selecting the SEQ # option provides dashed lines on the
MPCD connecting the waypoint/OAPs of the chosen sequence.
AUTO sequential steering is deactivated when any of the following occur: the AUTO option
deselected (unboxed), the last waypoint/OAP in the sequence is within the parameters mentioned
above, selection of another steering mode, the FCS is coupled to the D/L, AUTO update is selected, a
Figure 24-13. Waypoint/OAP Course Line Steering (Sheet 2 of 2)
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-44 ORIGINAL
ground point is designated, magnetic heading is invalid, aircraft present position is invalid, aircraft
ground track is invalid, or steering waypoint/OAP range/bearing is invalid.
Auto sequential steering is suspended if UPDT/DSG is selected to perform an overfly designation.
The automatic transition to the next waypoint does not take place until the update is either accepted
or rejected and the sequence criteria is satisfied.
24.2.14.5 Coupled Auto Sequential Steering. When auto sequential steering is coupled CPL SEQ
#( ) (current sequence number: 1, 2, 3, or L replaces the parenthesis) is displayed on the HUD and HSI
display and a CPLD advisory appears on the DDI. The aircraft steers to intercept the desired course
of the current WYPT/OAP in the sequence. Bank angle is limited by NAV or TAC mode as described
in chapter 2. As the aircraft gets close to the desired course, the bank angle is reduced to maintain the
aircraft on the desired course. An OVFLY( ) option is available on the WYPT data option display.
When this option is selected (boxed), the aircraft overflies the current WYPT/OAP in the sequence
before intercepting the course of the next one. When OVFLY( ) is not selected, the aircraft performs
a lead turn to intercept the course of the next WYPT/OAP just prior to reaching the current point.
Once the aircraft reaches the last point in the sequence, auto sequential steering uncouples, reverting
to HDG hold in the roll axis. RALT or BALT, whichever is selected, remains engaged when the aircraft
passes the final point. If auto sequential steering does not engage or disengages without being
commanded, an AUTOPILOT caution is displayed on the DDI, and CPL SEQ( ) flashes for 10 seconds
on the HUD and HSI displays. The caution can be cleared with the paddle switch.
Coupled AUTO sequential steering is selected and deactivated as described above in the Auto
Sequential Steering paragraph.
Coupled auto sequential steering is disengaged if UPDT/DSG is selected to perform an overfly
designation. The automatic transition to the next waypoint does not take place. When auto disengage
from coupled steering occurs, autopilot cautions occur. Coupled steering is not automatically reengaged
after the update is complete.
24.2.14.6 Groundspeed Cuing. Before groundspeed cuing is available for display, certain criteria
must be meant: a waypoint/OAP sequence must be entered, a target waypoint/OAP in the sequence
must be selected, time of day must be entered (ZTOD or LTOD), and TOT must be entered. With
waypoint/OAP great circle steering engaged to the target waypoint/OAP, the MC calculates the
groundspeed required to arrive at the target based on a direct path to the target and the entered TOT.
With AUTO sequential engaged, the MC calculates the groundspeed required to arrive at target
waypoint/OAP taking the sequential path to the target. The MC calculates the necessary groundspeed
based on the pilot entered groundspeed, providing there is enough time to travel the final leg at the
entered groundspeed and arrive at the target at the TOT. If there is not enough time to travel the final
leg at the pilot entered groundspeed, the MC ignores the pilot entered groundspeed and calculates a
groundspeed to arrive at the target on time.
NOTE
• Programming a required groundspeed is not necessary for groundspeed cuing calculations.
• The designated target waypoint/OAP must be in the waypoint/OAP
sequence in order for the required groundspeed cueing function to
operate.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-45 ORIGINAL
Figure 24-14. AUTO Sequential Steering
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-46 ORIGINAL
If the target is an OAP the groundspeed required calculation includes the distance from the OAP to
the offset. If the target is NAV designated the MC uses the NAV designation location in the calculation
of groundspeed required for TOT. When the target waypoint/OAP is NAV designated, any other
designation means may be used to adjust the designation and the groundspeed calculation is calculated
to the adjusted designation.
HUD cuing of required groundspeed consists of a tick mark and arrow head located under the
airspeed box. The arrow head is referenced to the tick mark and indicates if the aircraft is traveling too
fast or too slow to reach the target on time. The arrow head is displayed to the left of the tick mark
when the aircraft is traveling too slow and to the right of the tick mark when the aircraft is traveling
too fast. Full displacement of the arrow head left or right of the tick mark indicates a difference of 30
knots between actual and required groundspeed. The aircraft is traveling the correct speed when the
arrow head is centered on the tick mark. The required groundspeed readout is displayed on the MPCD
under the present ground speed readout. See figure 24-14 for an example of HUD and MPCD
groundspeed cuing.
24.2.15 Designation. Designation of a waypoint/OAP is the action by which the pilot identifies a
waypoint/OAP position to the MC so that position can be used for sensor slaving, steering, or position
updating. Navigation and overfly designations are discussed here but sensor designations are described
in A1-F18EA-TAC-Series. Designating a waypoint/OAP initiates the following changes on the MPCD:
the WPDSG option is removed/replaced with the O/S option, WYPT/OAP is replaced with a boxed
TGT/OAP legend, the waypoint symbol is replaced with the target diamond, the waypoint symbol
inside the waypoint steering pointer is also replaced with the target diamond and the steering
information in the upper right corner now relates to the target. Designating a waypoint/OAP also
provides the following changes on the HUD: a target diamond appears below the heading scale to
provide target heading information, another target diamond also appears indicating the target line of
sight (LOS) and the WYPT data (range) on the lower right corner is replaced with TGT data. HUD
target steering operates the same as described for waypoint/OAP great circle steering.
24.2.15.1 WPDSG (Navigation) Designation. Selecting the WPDSG option designates the waypoint
as a target. The changes mentioned above appear at designation, see figure 24-15.
To WPDSG an OAP the procedure is slightly different. When the WPDSG option is selected, the
OAP is designated and all data for the designated target on the MPCD and HUD operate the same as
described above, except that the WPDSG legend is replaced with the O/S option and the OAP option
is boxed. The O/S option must now be selected to add the offset data to the OAP position and complete
the designation. Another method of adding the offset data to the OAP position (completing the
designation) is to assign the TDC to the MPCD and actuate the TDC. When this occurs, the O/S legend
is removed, the boxed OAP legend is replaced with a boxed TGT legend, the offset symbol is replaced
with the target diamond and the designated aimpoint reverts to the aimpoint symbol. A WPDSG
cannot be performed if a waypoint/OAP is already designated.
24.2.15.2 Overfly Designation. An overfly designation is performed on a waypoint/OAP by pressing
the TDC while it is assigned to the MPCD and the aircraft is overflying the waypoint/OAP. When this
happens, the MC assumes that the aircraft is over the waypoint/OAP and the aircraft position at that
time is designated as the waypoint/OAP position. In the case of an OAP the offset data is automatically
added to the aircraft present position to complete the designation. When an overfly designation is
performed the changes mentioned above occur, see figure 24-16.

24.3 ADF (AUTOMATIC DIRECTION FINDER)
The OA-8697/ARD ADF is a VHF/UHF direction finder operating in the 100 to 400 MHz frequency
range. The system has an antenna section which receives and modulates rf signals and an audio
processing section which resolves bearing in the ADF audio received from the VHF/UHF receivertransmitter. Bearing information received by the ADF is sent to the MC where the data is processed
to position the ADF bearing pointer on the HSI display. The channel to the station to which ADF
bearing is required is selected on the COMM 1 or COMM 2 radio. The ADF system is turned on by
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-51 ORIGINAL
selecting the ADF option on the UFCD COMM sublevel for the selected radio. Squelch is disabled for
the selected radio when ADF is turned on. Squelch can be reenabled by reselecting the SQCH option.
Selecting the COMM 2 radio indicates ADF bearing to the station selected on the COMM 2 radio.
ADF audio is adjusted by either the COMM 1 or COMM 2 volume control knob. ADF symbology
appears as a small circle on the HSI display.
Aircraft after ECP 6061 may not have ADF installed. When ADF is enabled on the COMM sub-level
without an ADF installed the following will occur:
D The EADI bearing indicator will jump erratically as if no ADF signal is present.
D Squelch will be disabled on the selected radio.
D The radio selected for ADF will not receive (no antenna), but will still transmit.
24.4 TACAN (TACTICAL AIR NAVIGATION)
The RT-1159A/ARN-118 TACAN system or the Multifunctional Information Distribution System
(MIDS) when installed gives precise relative bearing and/or slant range distance to a TACAN ground
station or range to a suitably equipped aircraft. The TACAN system operates in the L-band frequency
range, limiting the operating range to line of sight, which depends upon aircraft altitude. The
maximum operating range is 390 nm when the selected TACAN station is a surface beacon and 200 nm
when the selected TACAN station is an airborne beacon. The aircraft receives a three letter Morse code
signal to identify the beacon being received. When operating in conjunction with aircraft having
air-to-air capability, the A/A mode provides line of sight distance between two aircraft operating
TACAN sets 63 channels apart. Up to five aircraft can determine line of sight distance from a sixth,
lead aircraft in the A/A mode.
In MIDS equipped aircraft, TACAN functionality is embedded in the MIDS terminal, replacing the
AN/ARN-118 in door 13R. To preclude MIDS interference with the IFF system, notch frequency
filters were placed in the MIDS TACAN antenna lines. The upper filter is fixed, while the lower filter
is switched in for Link-16 transmissions, and out for TACAN transmissions and all reception. Because
the upper antenna is fixed, it filters A/A TACAN frequencies on channels 1 - 36 and 64 - 99 (X and Y).
A/A TACAN channels should be chosen outside of these ranges. Because the upper antenna filter is
fixed, it filters A/A TACAN frequencies on channels 1−36 and 64−99 (X AND Y). A/A TACAN
channels should be chosen outside of these ranges. The upper filter makes the top antenna unusable
for T/R (AIR TO GROUND) TACAN channels 1−29 X and Y, 47X to 63X and 64Y to 92Y. For
TACAN channels in these ranges, the bottom antenna is the only antenna for TACAN. With a
centerline tank installed, the antenna is blocked approximately 180 ± 15° relative to the aircraft nose.
This shadowing of the bottom antenna, combined with the lower transmitter power of the MIDS
(200W versus 1000W for AN/ARN−118), causes reduced ranges for DME at channels within the range
of the filter when flying directly away from the TACAN station. Flight test data at afloat stations
shows that maximum tail-aspect DME ranges of approximately 22 nm at 6,000 feet and 26 nm at 15,000
feet can be expected making DME unreliable when headed outbound in the marshal stack. At shore
stations, flight tests have shown substantially better tail-aspect DME ranges (e.g. 52 nm at 15,000 feet).
DME ranges in the forward and side quadrants of the aircraft, and bearing performance in all
quadrants, are not impacted. Therefore, approach performance on the affected channels is nominal.
There is also attenuation on A/G TACAN channels 1 to 36 (X and Y), 40X to 63X, and 64Y to 99Y on
the upper antenna, but is less of a problem due to A/G TACAN using primarily lower antenna.
NOTE
MIDS equipped aircraft may experience TACAN bearing and DME
dropouts. MIDS equipped aircraft with a centerline tank may
experience loss of DME during outbound legs from TACAN stations 1
to 29X and Y, 47X to 63X and 64Y to 92Y.

24.4.1 TACAN BIT. A TACAN BIT check is manually initiated by ensuring the TACAN is turned on
and pressing the TCN/IFF option on the BIT sublevel display. If the TACAN is good, the DDI shows
the BIT status as GO. If the TACAN does not pass the BIT check, BIT status is DEGD. The TACAN
system also has an automatically initiated BIT. If the automatic BIT check detects a wrong signal or
a failure, TACAN DEGD is displayed on the BIT display and the BIT line on the left DDI. If no fault
is detected, nothing is displayed next to TCN. In MIDS equipped aircraft, the only way to execute a
TACAN BIT is by initiating a MIDS BIT. To run a MIDS BIT, MIDS must be selected in the COMM
submenu of the BIT display.
24.4.2 TACAN Mode Selection. To enable the TACAN system, select the TCN option on the UFCD
top level CNI display. The TACAN channel number is displayed on the TCN option. If the TACAN
is powered the TCN option is corner highlighted. If TCN is selected with no data entered in the
scratchpad the TACAN sublevel is displayed, see figure 24-17. TACAN operation is controlled from
the TACAN sublevel. The TACAN system is turned on by pressing the ON/OFF option on the TACAN
sublevel.
When the TACAN sublevel is selected, the following TACAN mode options appear: T/R (transmit/
receive), RCV (receive), A/A (air-to-air), and X and Y channel. Border highlights indicate which
TACAN mode is operating. In the T/R mode the TACAN computes bearing and measures slant range
from the selected TACAN station. In the RCV mode only bearing from the selected TACAN station
is computed. In the A/A mode, interrogations and replies are single pulse from one aircraft to another.
The TACAN channel mode is indicated in the X/Y option which is always border highlighted in the
TACAN sublevel and toggles between X and Y mode with each selection.
24.4.3 TACAN Programming. TACAN station data is entered by selecting the DATA option on the
MPCD top level display. Selecting the TCN option on the data sublevel display provides the TACAN
data sublevel display. This display shows the TACAN station lat/long position, elevation, and magnetic
variation. TACAN station data is entered by selecting the desired TACAN station number on the
UFCD keyboard. Pressing the X or Y option to select the TACAN channel, the POSN option enters
lat/long data, the ELEV option to enter elevation data, and the MVAR option to enter magnetic
variation. TACAN data is entered on the UFCD keypad for up to 252 TACAN stations (126 on X
channel, 126 on Y channel). See figure 24-18.

24.4.4 TACAN Position Keeping. The TACAN system may be used for position keeping purposes. To
do this the TACAN system must be in the T/R mode with the proper channel (X or Y) and channel
number selected. The TACAN station selected must be one of the prestored stations. Selecting the
POS/XXX option on the MPCD top level display provides the position keeping option display.
Selecting the TCN option as the position keeping source causes the MPCD top level display to be
returned and POS/TCN to be displayed as the position keeping source.
24.4.5 TACAN Position Updating. The TACAN system may also be used for position updating
purposes. To do this the TACAN system must be in the T/R mode with the proper channel (X or Y)
and channel number selected. The TACAN station selected must be one of the prestored stations.
Selecting the UPDT option on the MPCD top level display provides the UPDT option display.
Selecting the TCN option causes the MC to use position data from the selected TACAN station to
compute aircraft present position. The difference between the TACAN computed present position and
the on board determination of aircraft present position produces the position error readout in bearing
and range on the ACPT/REJ display. Selecting the ACPT option accepts the position update and
returns the MPCD top level display. Selecting the REJ option rejects the update and returns the
MPCD top level display.
24.4.5.1 TACAN Steering. Types of TACAN steering available for selection are direct great circle,
and course line steering. These TACAN steering options are mechanized identical to waypoint/OAP
direct great circle and course line steering, with steering being referenced to the TACAN. Selecting the
TCN option on the MPCD top level display provides TACAN direct great circle steering, see figure
24-19. Activating the CSEL switch with TACAN direct great circle steering selected provides TACAN
course line steering, see figure 24-20.
24.4.5.2 Coupled TACAN Steering. When TACAN steering is coupled, CPL TCN is displayed on the
HUD and HSI display and a CPLD advisory appears on the DDI. The aircraft steers to intercept the
desired course line, or flies to the TACAN station if no course line is selected. Bank angle is limited by
NAV or TAC mode as described in chapter 2. As the aircraft gets close to the desired course, the bank
angle is reduced to maintain the aircraft on the desired course. If a course line is selected, the aircraft
continues past the TACAN station on the outbound radial until the mode is decoupled. If no course
line is selected, TACAN steering uncouples when the aircraft reaches the TACAN station, reverting to
HDG hold. RALT or BALT, whichever is selected, remains engaged when the aircraft passes the
TACAN station. If TACAN steering does not engage or disengages without being commanded, an
AUTOPILOT caution is displayed on the DDI, and CPL TCN flashes for 10 seconds on the HUD and
HSI displays. The caution can be cleared with the paddle switch.
24.5 INSTRUMENT CARRIER LANDING SYSTEM (ICLS)
The AN/ARA-63A ICLS is an all weather approach guidance system which operates with an aircraft
carrier installed transmitting set AN/SPN-41. The ICLS decodes transmitted azimuth and elevation
signals during an approach and provides steering information for display on the HUD, standby attitude
reference indicator, and EADI. The major components of the AN/ARA-63A system are a receiver and
a decoder.
24.5.1 ICLS Receiver. The ICLS receiver receives coded transmissions of azimuth and elevation
guidance data from surface transmitters. The receiver transforms these signals into coded pulses

suitable for processing in the decoder. A BIT module for system BIT check is contained within the
receiver.
24.5.2 ICLS Decoder. The ICLS decoder receives and decodes azimuth and elevation pulses from the
receiver and converts them to azimuth and elevation command signals for the HUD and standby
attitude reference indicator.
24.5.3 ICLS BIT. An ICLS BIT check is manually initiated by ensuring the ICLS is on and selecting
the ILS/AUG/BCN/D/L option on the BIT sublevel display. If any of the BIT monitored outputs fail,
a BIT status message of DEGD (degraded) appears on the BIT sublevel display. If the BIT checks are
good, a BIT status message of GO appears on the BIT sublevel display.
24.5.4 ICLS Initialization. The ICLS is enabled by placing the ILS UFC/MAN switch on the COMM
control panel to the UFC position, pressing the D/L BCN ILS option, and pressing the ILS option, on
the UFCD. This allows the ICLS channel number and ON/OFF status to be displayed on the UFCD
and CHNL # to appear on the CHNL option, see figure 24-21. Pressing the ON/OFF option turns the
ICLS on. The ICLS channel may be changed (1 to 20) using the UFCD keypad. The ICLS is
automatically selected when the ACL data link mode is selected.
Another method of enabling the ICLS is to place the ILS UFCD/MAN switch on the COMM control
panel to the MAN position. When this is done the ICLS is turned on and the ILS channel push buttons
on the COMM control panel are used for channel selection. The letters MAN appear on the scratchpad
and below the CHNL option.
Figure 24-21. ICLS Initialization
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-58 ORIGINAL
24.5.5 ICLS Steering. When the ICLS is on and the ILS option on the MPCD top level display is
selected (boxed), ICLS steering is provided on the HUD, the standby attitude reference indicator, and
the EADI, see figure 24-22. The azimuth and elevation deviation bars are referenced to the velocity
vector. When the waterline symbol is displayed, the deviation bars are referenced to it. As shown, the
deviation bars are deflected full scale and the aircraft is below glide slope and to the left of course. The
azimuth bar is deflected full scale for azimuth deviations of ±6° to ±20°. The elevation bar is deflected
full-scale down for elevation deviations of 1.4° to 20°, and full-scale up for deviations of -1.4° to -3°.
If a valid azimuth or elevation signal is not received by the ICLS, the corresponding bar is not
displayed.
ICLS steering is automatically provided when the ACL mode is selected and valid ICLS steering
signals are received.
24.6 DATA LINK SYSTEM
All information on the data link system, except for the automatic carrier landing mode, is contained
in A1-F18EA-TAC-100. For typical Automatic Carrier Landing procedures, refer to Chapter 8.
24.6.1 Automatic Carrier Landing Mode. The system for automatic landing of aircraft onto the
aircraft carrier deck is comprised of the AN/SPN-42 or AN/SPN-46 installed aboard the carrier and
Automatic Carrier Landing (ACL) equipment installed in the aircraft. The aircraft data link system is
the ACL component over which steering commands are received from the carrier for guidance of the
aircraft.
The data link automatic carrier landing (ACL) mode is available only when the NAV master mode
is selected. The ACL steering commands may be coupled to the flight control computer for fully
automatic approaches to touchdown, or the pilot may elect to use the steering displays for a manually
controlled landing. The traffic control (T/C) mode is a submode of ACL. The T/C mode provides data
link heading commands to aid the pilot in reaching the marshal point and/or it may be used for
azimuth alignment from marshal until ACL acquisition. These heading commands can be coupled to
the flight control computer for automatic lateral axis control or can be used for manual steering aids.
Two uplinked control messages (label 5 and label 6) are uniquely addressed to a specific aircraft and
received by the data link for ACL mode (and T/C submode) control and display. The label 5 message
is used only for T/C mode, while both label 5 and label 6 are required for ACL Modes 1, 1A, and 2
control and display. The contents of the uplinked label 5 and label 6 messages follows:

Used by FCS for longitudinal axis control.
Lateral Axis Command
(roll angle in degrees)
Used by FCS for lateral axis control.
The ground station also periodically uplinks two universal test messages (UTM-3A and UTM-3B).
These two messages have a canned constant content and carry a universal address, rather than being
addressed uniquely to a controlled aircraft, as are the label 5 and label 6 messages. During ACL mode
test, the data link is commanded to accept these two UTM as part of the determination of onboard
ACL capability.
24.6.1.1 ACL Mode Displays. The ACL mode displays consist of the SA display on the DDI and the
data link situation display on the HUD. The following paragraphs contain a general description of the
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-61 ORIGINAL
displays related to the ACL mode. A more explicit definition of the utilization of these displays is
presented in ACL Mode Operation, this chapter.
24.6.1.1.1 SA Display. Figure 24-23 shows the ACL and T/C information which may be displayed on
the link SA display. The lettered symbols and cues on the display are described after the corresponding
letter in the following paragraphs.
a. The following uplinked group 1 discretes may be displayed in this slot:
LND CHK Landing check indicates that SPN-42/SPN-46 control radar communication has
been established. It also cues the pilot to be in the landing configuration with ATC
engaged.
ACL RDY ACL ready indicates that SPN-42/SPN-46 acquisition has occurred and uplinked
longitudinal axis (altitude rate) and lateral axis (roll rate) commands are being
received equal to zero. The ACL RDY indication is also displayed on the HUD.
Receipt of the ACL RDY discrete is one of the onboard prerequisites for ACL
couple.
CMD CNT Command control discrete indicates that the carrier has received a verbal confirmation from the pilot that FCS is coupled to the ACL longitudinal and lateral
commands, and further indicates to the pilot that longitudinal and lateral commands are now active.
W/O When this discrete is received the FCS is uncoupled from the uplinked commands.
Figure 24-23. DDI SA ACL Display
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-62 ORIGINAL
NOT CMD The not command discrete indicates that label 5 information is invalid. When this
discrete is received the label 5 information is removed from the SA display and the
FCS is uncoupled from the T/C heading command/ACL steering commands.
CHG
CHNL
The change channel discrete indicates that the data link frequency should be
changed.
b. The following ACL mode operational cues may be displayed in this slot.
MODE 1 Indicates that the entire loop is capable and ready for coupling for dual axes ACL
control.
MODE 2 Indicates that the entire loop is not capable of Mode 1 coupled approach but is
capable of Mode 2 manual control approach using uplinked situation steering.
T/C Traffic control cue indicates that the entire loop is capable and ready for couple to
the T/C heading command.
TILT Indicates that the uplinked information is not being updated. When this condition
exists all uplinked information is removed from the displays and the FCS is
uncoupled from the data link commands.
c. The following uplinked group 2 C discretes may be displayed in this slot. These cues are
displayed for 30 seconds after initial receipt, then removed.
10 SEC Indicates that SPN-42/SPN-46 is now adding deck motion compensation to the
longitudinal and lateral axes commands. This discrete is received approximately
12.5 seconds before touchdown.
ADJ A/C Adjacent aircraft cue indicates that another aircraft has been detected in the area
of controlled aircraft.
VOICE Indicates that the pilot is to establish voice contact with control.
d. The following onboard capability cues are displayed in this slot.
ACL 1 Indicates that onboard systems are capable of an ACL or T/C couple to the FCS.
ACL 2 Indicates that onboard systems are not capable of ACL or T/C couple to FCS, but
are capable of displaying uplinked information for a Mode 2 manual approach.
ACL N/A Indicates that onboard systems are not capable of using uplinked information and
that a carrier controlled approach (CCA) must be made.
TEST Indicates that ACL mode is in test.
e. The UTM FAIL cue is displayed in this slot when valid uplinked UTM 3A and UTM 3B were
not received during automatic test.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-63 ORIGINAL
f. Command heading is displayed by the double chevron symbol on the outside of the compass
rose.
g. Command airspeed is displayed in this slot.
h. Command altitude is displayed on this slot.
i. Command rate of descent is displayed in this slot.
j. The compass rose is track-up oriented with selectable ranges of 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 nm.
24.6.1.1.2 HUD ACL Display. Figure 24-24 shows the HUD ACL display information. The lettered
symbols and cues on the HUD are described after the corresponding letter in the following paragraphs.
a. Uplinked command heading is indicated by the command heading steering pointer below the
heading scale.
b. The following cues may be displayed in the command heading slot:
10 SEC Displayed for 30 seconds after receipt and then removed. Also displayed on SA display.
TILT Displayed when communication has been lost with data link control. Also on SA
display.
DATA Displayed for 10 seconds and flashed at a rate of two times per second when new
data is initially displayed on the SA display.
W/O When this discrete is received the FCS is uncoupled from the uplinked commands.
c. The following cues may be displayed in this slot:
ACL RDY Displayed when received via data link and the FCS is not coupled. Also displayed
on SA display.
CPL P/R Coupled in pitch and roll is displayed when the FCS is coupled to the longitudinal
and lateral commands. The cue is flashed for 10 seconds at two times per second
then removed if the couple attempt is unsuccessful, or if uncouple occurs for any
reason other than pilot deselection. Disengagement, other than pilot initiated, also
results in an AUTOPILOT caution.
CPL HDG Coupled to heading commands cue is displayed when FCS is coupled in the T/C
mode. This cue is flashed for the same reasons as described for the CPL P/R cue.
d. The following cues may be displayed in this slot. These cues may be displayed in any master
mode:
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-64 ORIGINAL
ATC Displayed when automatic throttle control is engaged. If an unsuccessful engagement attempt occurs, or if the ATC disengages for any reason other than pilot
deselection, the ATC cue is flashed for 10 seconds at two times per second, then
removed.
NWS Indicates low gain nosewheel steering is engaged.
NWS HI Indicates high gain nosewheel steering is engaged.
e. When ACL mode is initially selected, waypoint steering is automatically deselected, if selected,
and the system is automatically undesignated if an aimpoint is designated. If TACAN is on,
TACAN range is automatically displayed regardless of TACAN steering selection unless the
pilot subsequently designates an aimpoint or selects waypoint steering.
f. The tadpole steering symbol is referenced to the velocity vector and provides uplinked flight
path steering indications for the ACL glide slope and course.
24.6.1.2 ACL Mode Operation. The data link ACL mode is selected by actuating the ACL option
button on the MPCD.
24.6.1.2.1 Initialization. When selected, the ACL legend on the MPCD is boxed and the SA display
is automatically selected on the left DDI. The TEST cue is displayed indicating the ACL mode is in
test. The ICLS, data link, and radar beacon are automatically turned on if not previously on. IBIT is
run on the data link and radar beacon systems. The uplinked UTM is monitored for valid receipt.
When ACL testing is complete the TEST cue is removed, the systems are placed in the correct
operational mode, the stored data link ACL frequency is automatically selected, and the pilot is cued
on the SA display to onboard ACL capability (ACL 1, ACL 2, or ACL N/A) as previously described. If
during test, a valid uplinked UTM message was not received, the UTM FAIL cue is displayed on the
SA display.
Figure 24-24. HUD ACL Display
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-65 ORIGINAL
24.6.1.2.2 Traffic Control Couple. When an uplinked label 5 message is received, a determination is
automatically made relative to total loop capability. If the ACL loop is ready for a T/C couple, the T/C
cue appears on the SA display and autopilot options are initialized on the upfront control display with
the CPL HDG option displayed (figure 24-25). The prerequisites for a CPL HDG option for T/C
follows:
1. Onboard systems fully operational.
2. Valid label 5 message received.
3. Waveoff (W/O) discrete not received.
4. Uplinked information being updated (no TILT cue).
5. NOT CMD discrete not being received.
6. Label 6 message not being received.
With T/C displayed FCS couple is selected by actuating the CPL option button on the UFCD. When
coupling to the T/C heading command is successful a colon is displayed in front of the CPL option on
the UFCD and the CPL HDG cue is displayed on the HUD. After couple the FCS banks the aircraft
to a maximum of 30° to capture and hold the uplinked heading command. Aircraft pitch attitude may
be controlled by the pitch hold function of the heading hold mode or by the BALT or RALT altitude
hold modes of the autopilot. A T/C couple precludes use of all other outer loop autopilot modes except
BALT and RALT. The T/C couple disengages, with reversions as noted, for any of the following
reasons:
1. Heading hold mode disengagement with reversion to CAS operation.
2. Roll control stick steering engagement with reversion to lateral axis heading hold mode.
3. Loss of valid uplinked heading command for more than 10 seconds (TILT) with reversion to
lateral axis heading hold mode.
4. Pilot deselection of CPL option with reversion to lateral axis heading hold mode.
5. Pilot actuation of paddle switch with reversion to CAS.
6. Receipt of uplinked W/O discrete with reversion to lateral axis heading hold mode.
7. Receipt of uplinked NOT CMD discrete with reversion to lateral axis heading hold mode.
An unsuccessful T/C couple attempt, or disengagement of the T/C couple for any reason other than
pilot deselection, results in an AUTOPILOT caution as well as CPL HDG on the HUD flashing for 10
seconds.
24.6.1.2.3 ACL Mode 1. When an uplinked label 6 message is received, a determination is made with
respect to total loop capability relative to dual-axis (lateral and longitudinal) ACL couple. If ACL
couple is determined to be available, the Mode 1 cue is displayed on the SA display and the autopilot
options are initialized on the UFCD with CPL P/R option displayed as shown in figure 24-26.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-66 ORIGINAL
When the pilot selects the CPL P/R option on the UFCD, an ACL couple to the FCS is requested
if prerequisites are met.
NOTE
If FCS is already coupled to T/C command heading, actuation of the
CPL HDG option disengages T/C couple and a second actuation (CPL
P/R) requests ACL couple.
The MC prerequisites for initial ACL couple are:
Figure 24-25. Traffic Control Couple Display
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-67 ORIGINAL
1. Basic FCS outer loop (heading hold) engaged. If heading hold is not engaged when the CPL
option is actuated it is automatically requested, and when FCS indicates it is engaged, ACL couple
is requested.
2. Onboard test results indicate ACL 1 capability.
3. Uplinked ACL RDY discrete being received. ACL RDY is required for initial couple only. It is not
required after ACL couple occurs.
4. Uplinked A/P bit set to couple state.
Figure 24-26. ACL Mode 1 Display
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-68 ORIGINAL
5. Valid uplinked longitudinal and lateral axes commands being received (no TILT).
The CPL P/R option is highlighted on the UFCD and the CPL P/R cue is displayed on the HUD to
indicate FCS is coupled. When ACL couple initially occurs, the FCS fades in the longitudinal and
lateral uplinked commands to minimize engagement transients. After FCS is coupled to the dual-axis
commands, the FCS limits the accepted magnitude of the uplinked commands to prevent excessive
pitch or roll changes due to large and/or erroneous uplinked commands. When FCS is coupled to ACL,
uncouple occurs, with reversion as noted, for any of the following reasons.
1. Heading hold mode disengagement with reversion to CAS operation.
2. Pitch or roll control stick steering engagement with reversion to CAS when CSS is no longer
engaged.
3. WonW with reversion to CAS.
4. Paddle switch actuation with reversion to CAS.
5. UFCD CPL option actuation with reversion to CAS.
6. Receipt of W/O discrete with reversion to CAS.
7. Receipt of command degrading approach to Mode 2 state with reversion to CAS.
8. Loss of valid uplinked commands for more than 2 seconds (TILT) with reversion to CAS.
9. Detection of degraded onboard capability below that required for Mode 1 with reversion to CAS.
10. Selection of FLAPS AUTO.
11. MC Failure or selected to OFF
NOTE
With H2E+ and H3E MC OFPs, MC1 failed or selected to OFF and
coupled ACLS previously engaged, the option to re-couple to ACLS is
not presented on the autopilot page of the UFCD when MC1 is
restored. Deselecting and then reselecting ACL on the HSI will bring
the CPL P/R option back if all coupled ACL engagement conditions
are satisfied after the ACL TEST sequence is complete. If MC2 is
cycled with ACL selected, the CPL P/R option is available without
having to deselect/reselect ACL.
During an ACL coupled approach the D/L situation steering and the ICLS situation steering may
remain selected for HUD display to allow the pilot to monitor the progress of the automatic control in
capturing and holding the desired glide slope and azimuth.
NOTE
The D/L situation steering may be removed from the HUD by
unboxing ACL on the MPCD, however, reselection of the ACL option
reinitializes the system as described in section 24.6.1.2.1.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-24-69 ORIGINAL
24.6.1.2.4 ACL Mode 1A. For an ACL Mode 1A approach, the aircraft may be coupled to data link
commands as described in the Mode 1 paragraph, then uncoupled at minimums (200 feet and 0.5 mile)
and manual control as described for Mode 2 used the rest of the way to touchdown.
24.6.1.2.5 ACL Mode 2. When a label 6 message is initially received and a Mode 1 or Mode 2
capability exists, a Mode 2 manual approach may be made. Data link HUD steering is automatically
selected. The data link situation steering tadpole is displayed on the HUD with the tadpole referenced
to the velocity vector as shown in figure 24-26. The ICLS situation display may remain selected on the
HUD for crosscheck on the D/L situation display and/or either D/L or ICLS display may be deselected
by actuating the option button on the MPCD. Mode 2 approaches may be made with or without ATC
engaged, but ATC should be used for angle of attack/airspeed control, if it is available. If ATC is not
engaged the HUD angle of attack bracket should be used to control AOA/airspeed and the glide slope
maintained by flying the D/L situation steering display on the HUD.
24.6.1.3 Typical ACL Approach. Figures 24-26 and 24-27 describe the controls and displays for a
“canned” Mode 1 ACL approach. The ACL mode is optimized for the described approach, but
abbreviated approaches and/or deviations as required may be used, dependent upon existing
operational procedures and collaboration between the pilot and carrier control. Figure 24-27 shows a
plan view of the approach with controls and displays for selected points prior to marshal. Figure 24-28
shows descent from marshal to touchdown. The depicted scenario uses only D/L steering and
commands complemented with ICLS steering in order to more clearly define D/L capability. It does
not show TCN or WYPT steering which may be used in conjunction with, or independent of, D/L
steering during the approach.
24.7 NAVIGATION DATA ENTRY
The UFCD has two data entry protocols, Standard Data Entry (SDE) and Fast Data Entry (FDE).

24.7.1 Standard Data Entry. With MC OFP 18E, SDE digits are entered using the keyboard followed
by the enter (ENT) key. In many cases, the option for which the data is being entered must first be
selected prior to entering digits. Selection of the ENT option causes the digits in the scratchpad to
flash once, confirming that the ENT has been accepted. The majority of the data entry displays use
SDE protocol and are recognized by the presence of the ENT key.
24.7.2 Fast Data Entry. With MC OFP 18E some data, and with MC OFP H1E AND UP all data
are entered using the keyboard followed by selecting the option directly. This protocol does not use the
enter (ENT) key. With MC OFP 18E, MAN replaces ENT. With MC OFP H1E AND UP, NEWS
replaces ENT.
24.7.3 Data Entry Using the Shifted Keypad. The N-E-W-S option is provided on all UFCD data
entry displays with MC OFP H1E AND UP. The shifted keypad provides the ability to enter a negative

CHAPTER 25
Backup/Degraded Operations
25.1 MISSION COMPUTER FAILURE
25.1.1 Mission Computer Failure (Non-AMCD Aircraft). If there is a failure of MC 1 (navigation
computer) there are certain capabilities which are lost. Some basic navigation capabilities are provided
by the backup functions of MC 2. Functions not available when MC 1 is failed are the autopilot
functions, G limiter and roll limiter, map and navigation situations display, and GPS and the HUD
steering displays (except for data link). In addition, the HSI functions of position keeping source
selection, position updating, target marking, and data entry and display are not provided when MC 1
is failed. The functions provided by MC 2 are the basic HUD flight data; backup HSI display with INS,
TACAN and ADF information; mode II ACL capability; and automatic throttle control. The control of
CNI equipment by the UFCD is not affected by an MC 1 failure, and ILS steering is available on the
standby attitude indicator. No backup position keeping is provided if the INS fails when MC 1 is failed.
In this case the standby attitude reference indicator is used by MC 2 for attitude information and the
velocity vector is not displayed on the HUD.
Failure of MC 1 causes a loss of all DDI caution displays except MC 1,
HYD 1A, HYD 1B, HYD 2A, and HYD 2B.
25.1.1.1 Backup HUD Display. With MC 1 failed, the backup HUD display is identical with the
primary HUD display except that the bank angle scale is not provided and the heading scale is at the
same position as in the weapon delivery modes. The ghost velocity vector is provided during backup
operation and the velocity vector may be caged/uncaged.
25.1.1.2 Backup HSI Display. With MC 1 failed, the backup HSI display consists of a magnetic
compass rose oriented heading-up with a TACAN pointer and an ADF pointer. A digital readout of
TACAN bearing and distance and the station identifier are provided in the upper left corner. The INS
present position is displayed inside the compass rose at the top center. Waypoint 0 is displayed. The
ACL mode option pushbutton is displayed for selection.
25.1.2 Mission Computer Failure (AMCD Aircraft)
25.1.2.1 Mission Computer Failure (AMCD Aircraft) - Single. In the event of an MC failure, backup
functions are the same in either computer. Basic navigation and situational awareness functions are
available, and cautions and advisories are displayed. TACAN and IFF can be turned off/on in backup
mode. TACAN station ID or IFF mode code changes can be entered during backup mode operation.
The radar altimeter cannot be turned on/off, but the RALT bug can be entered via the UFCD. ACL
Mode II is available in MC backup mode. Autopilot, G-limiter and roll limiter are not available in MC
backup mode.
25.1.2.2 Mission Computer Failure (AMCD Aircraft) - Dual. When both MCs are offline or in
initialization, the SDC acts as the backup bus controller and transmits a limited HUD display of
essential flight information to the forward MPCD and forward UFCD. The FCC provides calibrated
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-25-1 ORIGINAL
airspeed, AOA, Mach, vertical velocity, and baro altitude. The CSC provides pitch and bank attitude
reference and radar altitude. See figure 25-1. The SDC also provides L ATS and R ATS cautions.
25.1.2.3 Backup Navigational Information on Backup HUD. The navigational information on the
backup HUD is identical to the full-up HUD. Limited A/A and no A/G support is available.
25.2 BACKUP ATTITUDE AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM
If a failure occurs in the primary attitude and navigation system (INS), output signals of pitch, roll,
magnetic heading, and airspeed are provided to the mission computer system for use in the backup
attitude navigation computations. The backup system consists of standby attitude reference indicator,
static power inverter, and magnetic azimuth detector.
25.2.1 Standby Attitude Reference Indicator. The standby attitude reference indicator (figure 25-2)
is a self-contained pitch and roll instrument which is mounted on the main instrument panel. An
electrically driven gyro maintains vertical orientation by use of an electronic erection system. The
erection system automatically cuts off when lateral accelerations exceed approximately 0.15 g. The
gyro spin speed and erection system provides a minimum of 3 minutes of attitude information with a
total power loss. Pitch and roll servos provide back up pitch and roll attitude for use by other systems.
The attitude presentation is 360° in roll, 92° in climb, and 78° in dive.
Figure 25-1. SDC Backup HUD Display (AMCD Aircraft)
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-25-2 ORIGINAL
25.2.2 Static Power Inverter. If there is an interruption or loss of aircraft ac power, 28 volt dc power
is applied to the static power inverter to produce the 115 volt ac power needed for standby attitude
reference indicator operation.
NOTE
The aft cockpit standby attitude reference indicator is not powered by
the essential bus. Hence, it only operates for 3 minutes after a loss of
aircraft ac power.
25.2.3 Magnetic Azimuth Detector. The magnetic azimuth detector (MAD) consists of three sensing
elements configured in a wye. The sensing elements are mounted so that average positions are
maintained in the horizontal component of the earth magnetic field. The air data functions process the
detected magnetic heading and develop the magnetic error compensation signals.
25.2.4 Backup Attitude and Navigation System Controls and Indicators. The controls and indicators for the backup system are on the MPCD (or aft cockpit 8 x 10 display for LOT 26 AND UP) and
the standby attitude reference indicator.
25.2.4.1 MPCD (or 8 x 10 Display). The MPCD (or 8 x 10 display) provides horizontal situation and
steering control displays.
25.2.4.2 Standby Attitude Reference Indicator Controls and Indicators. The controls and indicators on the standby attitude reference indicator (figure 25-2) are described as follows:
1. OFF flag. This flag is in view when power is removed or the pull to cage knob is pulled out.
2. Miniature aircraft. This represents the nose and wings of the aircraft and indicates pitch and roll
attitude relative to the horizon. The miniature aircraft is adjustable through ±5° of pitch trim by
rotating the pull to cage knob clockwise or counterclockwise when the knob is pushed in.
3. Pull to cage knob. The knob is pulled out and held to orient the gyro spin axis to the ARI case
(pitch position). When the knob is pulled out and rotated clockwise to engage detent, the ARI
becomes caged.
Do not lock the gyro in the caged position with the pull to cage knob if
the gyro is spinning. Damage to the gyro might occur if the indicator or
the aircraft is moved while the gyro is spinning and caged. If the knob is
in the locked position, it must be pulled out to clear the detent before it
can be turned counterclockwise.
4. Slip indicator (inclinometer). This mechanical indicator displays sideslip.
5. Rate of turn needle. This needle displays the rate of turn. One needle width of deflection indicates
a 90° per minute rate of turn.
6. Test switch. The vertical and horizontal pointers and rate of turn needle are deflected when the
test switch is pressed.
7. Pointer shield. This shield conceals the vertical pointer in the stowed position.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-25-3 ORIGINAL
8. Elevation deviation bar. This bar provides direction information for pitch steering.
9. Bank scale. The scale rotates with the aircraft to provide measurement of angular displacement
by the bank angle index during maneuvers.
10. Azimuth deviation bar. This bar provides direction information for azimuth steering.
11. Sky pointer. The pointer rotates with the aircraft to indicate vertical (sky) in any roll attitude.
12. Bank angle index. The index indicates vertical in any roll attitude.
13. Display sphere. The sphere is directly coupled to the gyro gimbals to provide a direct reading of
pitch and roll. The sphere is marked at each 5° in pitch.
25.3 NAVIGATION BACKUP
Position keeping for aircraft navigation requires available sources of heading information, attitude
information, and velocity. The INS normally provides position keeping for the aircraft. Under various
failure conditions alternate sources of heading, attitude, and/or velocity information may be used for
position keeping. The backup heading modes are discussed in a following paragraph. The attitude
reference indicator is the alternate source of attitude information. The alternate sources of velocity
information are air data (true airspeed and angle of attack) or radar doppler velocities. Air data vertical
velocity is an alternate velocity source if only the vertical component of INS velocity is invalid. The
flight control set is an alternate source for angle of attack information.
The system automatically reverts to alternate data sources under failure conditions. For example, air
data position keeping is automatically selected in case of an INS failure. If MIDS is installed and
operating, MIDS is automatically selected as the aircraft position keeping source when INS or GPS
fails. Because MIDS position keeping is unreliable, POS/ADC should be manually selected if
Figure 25-2. Standby Attitude Reference Indicator
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-25-4 ORIGINAL
POS/MIDS is displayed. Air data position keeping uses true airspeed, and angle of attack from the air
data functions, and the last computed wind or the wind inserted by the pilot on the UFCD. The wind
can also be updated during air data position keeping by performing a velocity update. A new wind is
calculated when the velocity update is accepted. The velocity vector on the HUD is flashed at a slow
rate (on for 0.8 seconds and off for 0.8 seconds) during air data position keeping. A POS/ADC caution
is displayed on the DDI along with a master caution light and tone when the INS reverts to ADC
position keeping.
The radar doppler velocities are automatically used by the mission computer if available and no
other velocity sources are available (INS, GPS and FCC air data failed). This applies whether or not
TACAN position keeping is selected. Doppler velocities are available when the radar is operating in a
doppler beam sharpened (DBS) mode or PVU mode. The MC automatically uses the doppler velocities
under these conditions if a DBS mode is selected or if velocity update is selected without accepting or
rejecting the update.
25.3.1 Navigation Controls and Indicators.
25.3.1.1 HSI Display. The symbols and digital readouts that normally appear on the HSI during
backup system operation are the same as in the INS operation except for the POS option display.
25.3.1.2 POS Option Display. Pressing the POS/ADC pushbutton on the HSI display commands the
mission computer to use air data function true air speed, MAD heading, and wind speed and direction
to compute aircraft latitude and longitude in waypoint steering computations.
25.3.2 Backup Heading Mode Control. If the INS computer fails or if the INS switch is rotated to
the GYRO position the INS reverts to the gyro mode and true heading is no longer available from the
INS. The mission computer slaves the INS platform heading with the MAD to provide damped
magnetic heading. The slaving of the INS platform to the MAD occurs in straight and level flight.
During maneuvers, when roll is greater than ±5° or pitch is greater than ±10°, the MAD output is not
used. Upon reversion to the Slaved heading mode, the bottom row of option selections on the HSI are
HDG/SLV, SYNC, and ERECT. The SYNC option can be used to quickly synchronize the heading
with the MAD output if a heading error exists. The MC automatically synchronizes the heading with
the MAD output when the heading error is greater than 11.25° during level flight. Pressing the ERECT
option commands the INS to increase the gains in the INS erection loops, fast-leveling the platform.
SYNC and ERECT are momentary options and should be used only in straight and level flight.
If it is desired to change the backup heading mode, the heading status option pushbutton should be
pressed (HDG/SLV in this case) and the available heading options (SLV, DG, and COMP) are
presented on the HSI. Selecting any of these options commands the MC to display the selected option
and the necessary controls for that option. For failure conditions the next best available source is
automatically selected.
Selection of the DG heading mode or failure of the MAD while in the HDG/SLV mode causes the
bottom pushbuttons on the HSI to display HDG/DG, HDG (arrow left), HDG (arrow right), and
ERECT. The MC computes aircraft heading using the INS platform heading as a smoothed heading
source to compensate for the difference between true north, platform heading (wander angle), and
earth rate. The aircrew may correct the aircraft heading by using the HDG slew option buttons.
Following the initial setting of heading, the MC provides heading compensation for earth rate but
changes in magnetic variation must be entered using the UFCD because the aircraft uses the last
known value of magnetic variation.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
VII-25-5 ORIGINAL
If the aircrew selects the compass heading mode, if the INS is turned off, or if the INS fails
completely the mission computer uses the MAD output, damped with body rate data from the flight
control system. During maneuvers, when roll is greater than ±5° or pitch is greater than ±10°, the flight
control system body rates are used to determine heading. In the compass heading (HDG/COMP) mode,
the bottom buttons are labeled HDG/COMP and ERECT. The ERECT option is displayed when the
INS is operating in the AHRS mode. The MC uses the last known magnetic variation to compute true
heading.
25.4 BACKUP FREQUENCY CONTROL
Backup frequency control for the radios in case of an UFCD or MPCD malfunction is provided by
the multiplex bus and a DDI display. The UFC backup (UFC BU) display can be selected from the
SUPT menu. Both comm 1 and comm 2 can be controlled from the UFC BU display. When the COM1
or COM2 button is pressed, the frequency on which that radio is operating is displayed below the
legend COM1 or COM2, as appropriate. A new frequency is selected by selecting OVRD and using the
numerical buttons along the sides of the display and the ENT button at the bottom. Frequencies can
be entered to 5 KHz of resolution. As the new frequency is entered, it is displayed in the scratchpad
above the COM1 or COM2 legend. When the ENT button is pressed, the frequency displayed in the
scratchpad is stored in the mission computer as the preset frequency for the radio. Pressing the CLR
button clears the scratch pad if an error is made when entering a backup frequency. Selecting the
OVRD option in the upper right corner of the display boxes the option and the radio operates on the
preset frequency stored in the mission computer, overriding the normal frequency control from the
UFCD. Frequency control reverts to the UFCD when OVRD is deselected. The frequency displayed
below the COM1 or COM2 legend is always the frequency on which the radio is operating, whether or
not OVRD is selected. Upon power up with WonW, the preset frequencies stored in the mission
computer for COM1 and COM2 are initialized to be the same as the last valid radio operating
frequencies.

CHAPTER 28
Aircrew Coordination
28.1 DEFINITION
Aircrew coordination is the use and integration of all available skills and resources to collectively
achieve and maintain flight efficiency, situational awareness, and mission effectiveness.
28.2 CRITICAL SKILLS OF AIRCREW COORDINATION
28.2.1 Situation Awareness. The degree of accuracy by which one’s perception of the current
environment mirrors reality. It is the ability to identify the source and nature of problems, extract and
interpret essential information, maintain an accurate perception of the external environment, and
detect a situation requiring action. Mission accomplishment depends on the level of situational
awareness of all members of the flight and of outside agencies.
28.2.2 Assertiveness. An individual’s willingness to actively participate, state, and maintain a
position until convinced by the facts that the other options are better.
28.2.3 Decision-Making. The ability to choose a course of action using logical and sound judgement
based on available information. Effective decision making requires assessing the situation, verifying
information, identifying solutions, anticipating the consequences of decisions, making the decision,
informing others of the decisions and rationale, and evaluating the decision. Good decisions optimize
risk management and minimize errors. Poor decisions can increase errors, lead to mission failure, and
are a leading cause of mishaps.
28.2.4 Communication. The ability to clearly and accurately send and acknowledge information,
instructions, or commands and provide useful feedback. Effective aircrew communication skills ensure
timely transfer and assimilation of accurate information and provide useful feedback. Open, professional communication that avoids defensiveness and encourages accurate understanding of the
intended message is critical to information flow in the flight. Aviators should be aware of the basic
sociological, psychological, and environmental barriers to communications, and attempt to overcome
them.
28.2.5 Leadership. The ability to direct and coordinate the activities of other crewmwmbers or
wingmen, and to stimulate the flight to work together as a team. The ultimate responsibility for safety
of flight rests with the aircraft commander/pilot in command; however, every crewmember has a
responsibility for safety of flight, compliance with NATOPS and SOP, and mission accomplishment.
Within the chain of command each crewmember must exercise vigilance and support the aircraft
commander with timely recommendations and back up as directed.
28.2.6 Adaptability/Flexibility. The ability to alter a course of action based on new information,
maintain constructive behavior pressure, and adapt to internal and external environment changes. The
critical aspects are anticipating problems, recognizing and acknowledging any changes or abnormalities, taking alternative actions, providing and asking for assistance, and interacting constructively with
flight members. The success of a mission depends on the ability to alter behavior and dramatically
manage flight resources to meet situational demands.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IX-28-1 ORIGINAL
28.2.7 Mission Analysis. The ability to develop short-term, long-term, and contingency plans; and to
coordinate, allocate, and monitor crew and aircraft resources. Effective planning leads to flight conduct
that removes uncertainty, increases mission effectiveness, and enhances safety.
28.2.8 Factors That Degrade Aircrew Coordination.
1. Fixation on one task to the detriment of others.
2. Confusion.
3. Violation of NATOPS/FLIGHT minimums.
4. Violation of SOP.
5. No one in charge.
6. No lookout doctrine.
7. Failure to meet mission/planning milestones.
8. Absence of communication.
28.3 FLIGHT MEMBER POSITIONS
28.3.1 Mission Commander. The mission commander shall be a qualified naval aviator or naval
flight officer designated by appropriate authority. The mission commander shall be responsible for all
phases of the assigned mission except those aspects of safety-of-flight which relate to the physical
control of aircraft and within the prerogatives of the pilot in command. In accomplishing this, the
mission commander may exercise command over a single naval aircraft or formations of naval aircraft.
The mission commander shall direct a coordinated plan of action and be responsible for effectiveness
of the mission. Mission commander responsibilities include, but are not limited to:
1. Allocation of assets.
2. Supervision and allocation of planning tasks.
3. Assessment of capabilities and limitations of the flight.
4. Establishment of go/no-go criteria.
5. Assignment of roles and responsibilities.
6. Assurance of compliance with applicable orders, directives, and ROE/ROC.
28.3.2 Pilot In Command. The pilot in command is the pilot of an individual aircraft. The pilot in
command is responsible for the safe, orderly flight of the aircraft and the well-being of the crew. In the
absence of direct orders from higher authority cognizant of the mission, responsibility for starting or
continuing a mission with regard to weather or any other condition affecting the safety of the aircraft
rests with the pilot in command. The pilot in command may also be mission commander or formation
leader when so designated.
28.3.3 Formation Leader. A formation of one or more naval aircraft shall be under the direction of
a formation leader who is authorized to pilot naval aircraft. The formation leader is responsible for the
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IX-28-2 ORIGINAL
safe and orderly conduct of the formation. The status of each member of the formation shall be clearly
briefed and understood prior to takeoff. The formation leader may also be the mission commander
when so designated.
28.3.4 Weapon Systems Operator (WSO). The WSO is directly involved in all operations and weapon
systems employment of the F/A-18F aircraft except actual control of the aircraft. The WSO integrates
with the pilot to collectively achieve and maintain crew efficiency, situational awareness, and mission
effectiveness. When designated as mission commander, the WSO is also responsible for all phases of
the assigned mission.
28.4 AIRCREW RESPONSIBILITIES BY FLIGHT PHASE
28.4.1 Mission Planning and Briefing. All members of the flight should be involved in the mission
planning process and must be familiar with the mission requirements prior to the brief. The flight brief
shall be conducted with all members of the flight present. Any supporting assets (such as GCI, fighter
escort, EW, etc.) shall be briefed face-to-face, if possible. Flights requiring special coordination or
control should also be briefed face-to-face. Each type of flight or phase of flight may require unique
briefing requirements.
28.4.2 Pretakeoff. Aircraft discrepancy book (ADB) review, preflight, prestart, and poststart evolutions are conducted individually with the aid of ground maintenance crews (plane captains, trouble
shooters, ordnance handlers, etc.). Timing must be considered when coordinating operations with other
activities. Marshalling and taxi as a flight should be in order with special emphasis on FOD avoidance.
A minimum taxi interval should be emphasized for FOD considerations. During section taxi the
wingman should not focus on other tasks or get behind.
28.4.3 Takeoff/Departure. The following should be considered and briefed when conducting a
formation takeoff in addition to the typical takeoff considerations such as gross weight, performance,
and abort capability:
• Interval for FOD avoidance
• Staggered line-up for abort
• Crosswind handling characteristics
• Jet exhaust/turbulence patterns
• Abort criteria and configuration changes prior to IMC
• Wingman positioning
• Airspeed
• Runway length/conditions
• Abort speed/procedures
Departure procedures are dependent upon weather and mission requirements.
The following are some considerations that may require crew coordination:
• Clearance compliance
• Climb schedule and interval of multi-plane formations
• Weather avoidance or penetration
• Individual departure to join on top
28.4.4 Enroute. Enroute procedures may differ greatly depending on mission requirements.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IX-28-3 ORIGINAL
28.4.5 Recovery. Egress, approach, and landing operations are numerous and dependent upon
mission objectives, weather, and types of landing. The following elements should be considered and
may require aircrew coordination:
• Navigation and communication systems management
• Course rules and re-entry procedures
• Approach and landing weather
• Landing type and capabilities (e.g., gross weight, crosswind limitations, asymmetry limitations,
etc.)
• Fuel for normal and alternate recoveries
• Formation size and composition based upon maneuverability and landing area congestion
• Instrument recovery/penetration procedures (single aircraft and/or formation)
• Power and maneuvering margins for wing men
• Jet wash and turbulence avoidance
• Terminal control/LSO procedures
• Landing interval and priorities
• FOD avoidance during landing and taxi
• De-arming procedures
28.4.6 Mission Critique. Mission assessment is critical following a flight whether the mission was a
multi-aircraft strike, an FCLP period, or a functional check flight. A critical and credible debrief of
mission effectiveness improves future mission success and enhances aircrew and supporting agency
coordination. A proper debrief should provide flight members and supporting agencies with information on strengths and weaknesses so that future training and mission planning can focus on problem
areas and exploitation of strong areas.
28.5 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
28.5.1 Functional Checkflights. All requirements for functional checkflights are listed in
OPNAVINST 4790.2 (Series) and are to be performed using the applicable functional check flight
checklist. Crew coordination shall be in accordance with standard NATOPS procedures and apply
during the entire checkflight. F/A-18 NATOPS Chapter 10 outlines checks to establish acceptance
standards for the systems peculiar to the F/A-18E/F aircraft. All instrument and indicator readings,
warning lights, and radar and navigation displays in the rear cockpit shall be compared throughout the
flight with the corresponding information available from the front cockpit. Close crew coordination
ensures proper and correct utilization of all functional check flight procedures.
28.5.2 Formation Flights. Formation flights involving two or more aircraft require a high degree of
crew coordination to ensure mission accomplishment and to reduce mid-air collision potential.
28.6 EMERGENCIES
Mission planning and briefing should address contingencies which may affect the flight. Proper
planning minimizes the effect of deviations from the planned mission. The possibility of a mission
abort, or even the loss of an aircraft or aircrew, can be significantly reduced by anticipating critical
phases of flight and preparing for potential emergency situations. An example is the thorough brief of
bird strike emergencies and divert fields along a low-level navigation route. Part V contains procedures
to correct an abnormal or emergency condition. Modify these procedures as required in cases of
multiple emergencies, adverse weather, or other peculiar factors. Use common sense and sound
judgement to determine the correct course of action.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IX-28-4 ORIGINAL
CHAPTER 29
Crew Coordination Standards
29.1 PHILOSOPHY
F/A-18F crews tactically employ the aircraft utilizing community-wide standards for taskassignment and crew coordination. The F/A-18F community’s disciplined and standardized approach
to crew coordination enables any combination of pilot and WSO to benefit from life-saving, individual
habit patterns while implementing a time-tested system of checks and balances.
Crews must approach F/A-18F employment with an understanding that mission accomplishment
depends upon effective crew coordination and that crew coordination is an obligation equally shared.
The pilot is responsible for safety of flight, formation keeping, threat awareness, and weapons
employment. The WSO is responsible for avionics, weapons and sensors interface, communication, and
copilot duties. The most effective crews will complete their individual assignments while monitoring
the progress of the mission as a whole.
What follows are the crew coordination standards for administrative phases of flight. The
information contained herein is not meant to be used as a checklist, but should serve as a guide for
ensuring the aircrew work together effectively as a team. For tactical crew coordination standards, refer
to the Strike Fighter Squadron One Two Two Crew Coordination Standardization Manual.
29.2 MISSION PLANNING
Pilots and WSOs share mission planning responsibilities as delegated by the mission commander.
29.3 CREW BRIEFING
Individual crews shall discuss mission related coordination points and review relevant crew
coordination standards before each flight.
29.4 COMMUNICATIONS
Pilot
1. Make administrative inter-flight communications to include dressing the formation, fuel and g
checks, and configuration changes.
WSO
1. Change radio frequencies as required.
2. Perform all other non-administrative, inter-flight communications.
29.4.1 Intra-Cockpit Communications (ICS). Crews will strive to fly with minimal ICS communication. Following crew coordination standards and using standard F/A-18F terminology and guidelines
minimizes ICS requirements and builds situational awareness.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
IX-29-1 ORIGINAL
29.4.2 Guidelines for Effective Communications.
• ICS communication regarding aircraft/aircrew survivability has priority over all other communications (ICS or radio).
• Use ICS Standard Communication Brevity Terms, delineated in paragraph 29.9, to minimize
and standardize ICS communication.
• Adjust ICS volumes and VOX sensitivities throughout flight so that administrative communications and tactical communications/tone (weapon/RWR) are appropriately balanced.
• Do not communicate via ICS over incoming or outgoing radio transmissions unless a safety of
flight or time-critical mission situation exists.
• Time ICS communications to allow the flight to gain/maintain SA via radio transmissions.
• Lead with directive communication and follow-up with descriptive communication.
• Limit descriptive communication during critical flight phases.
• Communicate visual acquisitions and lost sight situations ASAP.
• Communicate information pertinent to the entire flight via radio communications.
• Either aircrew may change the Master Mode, Bingo bug, or RALT setting, but must alert the
other crewmember of the change via ICS. Changes to navigation system by either crewmember
should also be enunciated.
29.5 PRE-FLIGHT
Pilots and WSOs shall both read the Aircraft Data Book. The pilot in command signs for the aircraft.
Whenever possible the crew will walk together to the aircraft. Both the pilot and WSO shall account
for the aircraft pins and verify the VDEDP codes are correct. After the VDEDP codes are verified, the
pilot and WSO will split apart to conduct individual pre-flight inspections in accordance with Chapter
7. The pilot will walk clockwise around the aircraft while the WSO will walk counter-clockwise. Notify
the other crewmember, as well as maintenance personnel, of any discrepancies found during the
inspection. Both the pilot and WSO shall verify all panels are closed before manning the aircraft.

should give special attention to briefing those malfunctions or emergencies that are more likely to occur
as a result of a maintenance action taken.
29.8.2 Emergencies.
The primary responsibility of the aircrew during the resolution of an aircraft malfunction or
emergency is to fly the aircraft safely. During an emergency, the assistance of the WSO is of the utmost
value. After backing up the pilot on completion of NATOPS boldface procedures, the WSO should
review the appropriate emergency checklist with the pilot while monitoring the flight performance of
the aircraft. It is recommended a challenge-reply format be used for working through the checklist and
it is important the WSO set a pace that ensures no steps are missed.
Pilot
1. Maintain safe control of the aircraft.

CHAPTER 30
NATOPS Evaluation
30.1 CONCEPT
The standard operating procedures prescribed in this manual represent the optimum method of
operating the F/A-18 aircraft. The NATOPS Evaluation is intended to evaluate compliance with
NATOPS procedures by observing and grading individuals and units. This evaluation is tailored for
compatibility with various operational commitments and missions of both Navy and Marine Corps
units. The prime objective of the NATOPS Evaluation program is to assist the unit commanding
officer in improving unit readiness and safety through constructive comment. Maximum benefit from
the NATOPS Program is achieved only through the vigorous support of the program by commanding
officers as well as flight crewmembers.
30.1.1 Implementation. The NATOPS Evaluation program shall be carried out in every unit
operating naval aircraft. Pilots desiring to attain/retain qualification in the F/A-18 shall be evaluated
initially in accordance with OPNAVINST 3710.7 series, and at least once during the twelve months
following initial and subsequent evaluations. Individual and unit NATOPS Evaluations are conducted
annually; however, instruction in and observation of adherence to NATOPS procedures must be on a
daily basis within each unit to obtain maximum benefits from the program. The NATOPS Coordinators, Evaluators, and Instructors shall administer the program as outlined in OPNAVINST 3710.7
series. Evaluees who receive a grade of Unqualified on a ground or flight evaluation shall be allowed 30
days in which to complete a reevaluation. A maximum of 60 days may elapse between the date the
initial ground evaluation was commenced and the date the flight evaluation is satisfactorily completed.
30.1.2 Definitions. The following terms, used throughout this section, are defined as to their specific
meaning within the NATOPS program.
30.1.2.1 NATOPS Evaluation. A periodic evaluation of individual flight crewmember standardization consisting of an open book examination, a closed book examination, an oral examination, and a
flight evaluation.
30.1.2.2 NATOPS Reevaluation. A partial NATOPS Evaluation administered to a flight crewmember who has been placed in an Unqualified status by receiving an Unqualified grade for any of his
ground examinations or the flight evaluations. Only those areas in which an unsatisfactory level was
noted need be observed during a reevaluation.
30.1.2.3 Qualified. A qualified evaluation means that a flight crewmember is well standardized and
demonstrates highly professional knowledge of and compliance with NATOPS standards and procedures. Momentary deviations from or minor omission in non-critical areas are permitted if prompt and
timely remedial action is initiated by the evaluee.
30.1.2.4 Conditionally Qualified. A conditionally qualified evaluation means that a flight crewmember is satisfactorily standardized. One or more significant deviations from NATOPS standards and
procedures, but had no errors in critical areas and no errors jeopardizing mission accomplishment or
flight safety.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
X-30-1 ORIGINAL
30.1.2.5 Unqualified. An unqualified evaluation means that a flight crewmember is not acceptably
standardized and fails to meet minimum standards regarding knowledge of and/or ability to apply
NATOPS procedures, one or more significant deviations from NATOPS standards and procedures
which could jeopardize mission accomplishment or flight safety.
30.1.2.6 Area. A performance area consisting of preflight, flight, or postflight.
30.1.2.7 Sub-area. A performance sub-division within an area, which is observed and evaluated
during an evaluation flight.
30.1.2.8 Critical Area/Sub-area. Any area or sub-area which covers items of significant importance
to the overall mission requirements, the marginal performance of which would jeopardize safe conduct
of the flight.
30.1.2.9 Emergency. An aircraft component, system failure, or condition which requires instantaneous recognition, analysis, and proper action.
30.1.2.10 Malfunction. An aircraft component or system failure or condition which requires recognition and analysis, but which permits more deliberate action than that required for an emergency.
30.2 GROUND EVALUATION
30.2.1 General. Prior to commencing the flight evaluation, an evaluee must achieve a minimum
grade of Qualified on the open book and closed book examinations. The oral examination is also part
of the ground evaluation but may be conducted as part of the flight evaluation. To assure a degree of
standardization between units, the NATOPS instructors may use the bank of questions contained in
this section in preparing portions of the written examinations.
30.2.1.1 Open Book Examination. The open book examination shall consist of, but not be limited to,
the question bank. The purpose of the open book examination portion of the written examination is to
evaluate the knowledge of appropriate publications and of the aircraft.
30.2.1.2 Closed Book Examination. The closed book examination may be taken from, but not
limited to, the question bank and shall include questions concerning normal/emergency procedures
and aircraft limitations. Questions designated critical shall be so marked.
30.2.1.3 Oral Examination. The questions may be taken from this manual and drawn from the
experience of the Instructor/Evaluator. Questions should be direct and positive and should in no way
be opinionated.
30.2.1.4 OFT/WST Procedures Evaluation. An OFT may be used to assist in measuring flight
crewmember efficiency in the execution of normal operating procedures and reaction to emergencies
and malfunctions. In areas not served by an OFT, this may be done by placing the flight crewmember
in an aircraft and administering appropriate questions.
30.2.1.5 NAMT Systems Check. If desired by the individual squadron, Naval Air Maintenance
Trainer facilities may be utilized to evaluate flight crewmember knowledge of aircraft systems and
normal and emergency procedures.
30.2.1.6 Grading Instructions. Examination grades shall be computed on a 4.0 scale and converted
to an adjective grade of Qualified or Unqualified.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
X-30-2 ORIGINAL
30.2.1.6.1 Open Book Examination. To obtain a grade of Qualified, an evaluee must obtain a
minimum score of 3.5.
30.2.1.6.2 Closed Book Examination. To obtain a grade of Qualified, an evaluee must obtain a
minimum score of 3.3.
30.2.1.6.3 Oral Examination and OFT Procedure Check (If Conducted). A grade of Qualified or
Unqualified shall be assigned by the Instructor/Evaluator.
30.3 FLIGHT EVALUATION
The flight evaluation should be conducted in an OFT but may be conducted on any routine syllabus
flight with the exception of flights launched for FCLP/CARQUAL training. Emergencies shall not be
simulated unless the flight is accomplished in an F/A-18F with a qualified IP in the rear seat.
The number of flights required to complete the flight evaluation should be kept to a minimum;
normally one flight. The areas and sub-areas to be observed and graded on a flight evaluation are
outlined in the grading criteria with critical areas marked by an asterisk (*). Sub-area grades shall be
assigned in accordance with the grading criteria. These sub-areas shall be combined to arrive at the
overall grade for the flight. Area grades, if desired, shall also be determined in this manner.
The areas and sub-areas in which flight crewmembers may be observed and graded for adherence to
standardized operating procedures are outlined in the following paragraphs.
NOTE
• If desired, units with training missions may expand the flight evaluation to include evaluation of standardized training methods and
techniques.

X-30-4 ORIGINAL
30.3.12 Flight Evaluation Grading Criteria. Only those sub-areas provided or required will be
graded. The grades assigned for a sub-area shall be determined by comparing the degree of adherence
to standard operating procedures with adjectival ratings listed below. Momentary deviations from
standard operating procedures should not be considered as disqualifying provided such deviations do
not jeopardize flight safety and the evaluee applies prompt corrective action.
30.3.13 Flight Evaluation Grade Determination. The following procedure shall be used in determining the flight evaluation grade: A grade of Unqualified in any critical area/sub-area shall result in
an overall grade of Unqualified for the flight. If not unqualified, flight evaluation (or area) grades shall
be determined by assigning the following numerical equivalents to the adjective grade for each
sub-area. Only the numerals 0, 2 or 4 shall be assigned in a sub-area. No interpolation is allowed.
Unqualified
Conditionally qualified
Qualified
0.0
2.0
4.0
The numerical grade is determined for each area and the overall grade for the flight, adding all the
points assigned to the sub-areas and dividing this sum by the number of sub-areas graded. The
adjective grade shall then be determined on the basis of the following scale.
Unqualified
Conditionally qualified
Qualified
0.0 to 2.19
2.2 to 2.99
3.0 to 4.0
EXAMPLE: (Add Sub-area numerical equivalents) (4+2+4+2+4) ÷ 5 =3.20 Qualified
30.3.13.1 Final Grade Determination. The final NATOPS Evaluation grade shall be the same as the
grade assigned to the flight evaluation. An evaluee who receives an Unqualified on any ground
examination or the flight evaluation shall be placed in an Unqualified status until achieving a grade of
Conditionally Qualified or Qualified on a reevaluation.
30.3.13.2 Records and Reports. A NATOPS Evaluation Report (OPNAV Form 3510-8) shall be
completed for each evaluation and forwarded to the evaluee’s commanding officer only. This report
shall be permanently filed in the individual NATOPS Flight Personnel Training/Qualification jacket.
30.3.13.3 Critique. The critique is the terminal point in the NATOPS evaluation and shall be given
by the Evaluator/Instructor administering the check. Preparation for the critique involves processing,
reconstructing data collected, and oral presentation of the NATOPS Evaluation Report. Deviations
from standard operating procedures shall be covered in detail using all collected data and worksheets
as a guide. Upon completion of the critique, the flight crewmember receives the completed copy of the
NATOPS Evaluation Report for certification and signature. The completed NATOPS Evaluation
Report is then presented to the Unit Commanding Officer.
30.3.13.4 NATOPS Evaluation Question Bank. The following bank of questions is intended to assist
the unit NATOPS Instructor/Evaluator in the preparation of ground examinations and to provide an
abbreviated study guide. The questions from the bank may be combined with locally originated
questions in the preparation of ground examinations. The closed book exam shall consist of no less
than 50 questions. The time limit for the closed book exam is 1 hour and 30 minutes. The requirements
for the open book exam are the same as those for the closed book exam, except there is no time limit.

Aircraft Differences
(LOTs 21 - 22 Aircraft)
AIRCRAFT DIFFERENCES (LOTs 21 - 22 Aircraft)
The baseline aircraft for the NATOPS manual is aircraft 165779 and up. As a result, this chapter
documents the differences from the baseline aircraft for aircraft 165533 thru 165679.
The numbering scheme for this chapter differs from that used throughout the NATOPS manual.
The ″B″ indicates the text is from this chapter, however the remaining numbers indicate the specific
paragraph in this manual affected by the difference.
B.2.1.1.1.13 ABLIM - Afterburner Limiting Function. The ABLIM function is disabled with a FCC
CH 1, 2, or 4; MC1, FADEC, or INS failure.
B.2.5.3.6 Automatic Battery Cutoff (LOT 21 Aircraft). Automatic battery cutoff occurs after 1
minute.
B.2.5.3.7 Battery Gauge (LOT 21 Aircraft). There is no cockpit indication of battery voltage. Refer to
figure B-FO-1.
B.2.5.3.8 BATT SW Caution and Caution Light (LOT 21 Aircraft). The BATT SW caution and
caution light are set to alert the aircrew of an improperly placed BATT switch, or a battery related
malfunction. After a dual GEN failure, the BATT SW caution light must be referenced to determine
whether an EBB PMG or the battery is powering the essential bus. These cautions are set in only four
circumstances.
1. The BATT switch is ON on the ground in the absence of ac power (i.e., first engine start). The
battery is depleting and the switch should be placed to OFF unless APU start is about to be made.
2. The BATT switch is OFF inflight and should be placed to ON to provide essential bus backup
capability from the PMGs and battery.
3. The battery is not being recharged inflight (BATT switch ON). The battery charger has failed or
the right generator has failed with the buses isolated (R GEN and GEN TIE cautions).
4. The battery is powering the essential bus inflight. A dual generator failure and a dual PMG
failure has occurred and at least 5 to 10 minutes of battery power remains to run the FCCs.
B.2.9.1.1 LEX Vents. This section was deleted from the NATOPS. However, although physically
present on the aircraft, the LEX vents have been completely disabled in FCS logic and should be in the
full up position at all times.
B.2.10.1.1 Spoilers. The spoilers are mounted on top of the fuselage near the aft end of the LEX. The
spoilers are controlled by the FCCs and have three fixed positions: 0° (down), 13° TEU, or 60° TEU.
A1-F18EA-NFM-000
B-1 ORIGINAL
The spoilers are commanded to the 13° TEU position at greater than Mach 1.5 to open engine inlet
bleed air doors. The 60° TEU position is activated by the speed brake function or when more than 15°
TED stabilator is commanded (forward stick) above 22° AOA to aid in recovery from high AOA.
B.2.10.2 FCCs - Flight Control Computers (LOT 22 and up Aircraft). These aircraft do not have
Attitude and Heading Reference Sets (AHRS).
B.2.10.7.4 G-Bucket (Before FCC Software 18E-004). Due to the aerodynamic phenomenon known
as transonic pitchup, the g-limiter incorporates a g-bucket designed to prevent an aircraft over-g
during transonic deceleration. In the g-bucket, the g-limiter reduces the positive command g-limit to
a value below Nz REF. This reduction is 1.0g above 20,000 ft and 1.7g below 15,000 ft, but at no time
is the symmetrical command limit reduced below +4.5g. For instance, if Nz REF is +7.5 g (at or below
42,097 lb GW), the g-limiter only allows +5.8 g to be commanded while in the g-bucket. FSR limits are
also reduced in the g-bucket to 80% of (Nz REF minus the reduction).
The Mach numbers at which the g-bucket is entered are dependent on external stores configuration.
The g-bucket is entered at Mach 0.905 accelerating (with wing tanks or A/G stores) or at Mach 0.941
accelerating (clean or with A/A stores). Regardless of stores loading, the g-bucket is entered at Mach
1.045 decelerating and is exited at Mach 0.875 decelerating. So, if the pilot wants to have maximum-g
available during a turning maneuver (e.g., the merge), Mach in the HUD should be 0.90 or less (with
wing tanks or A/G stores) or 0.93 or less (clean or with A/A stores) to keep out of the g-bucket.
